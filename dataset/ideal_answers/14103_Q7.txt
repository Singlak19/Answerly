The full virtualisation, the devices are emulated. these devices are emulated. These devices include network adapters, RAM memory, DMA etc. the problem with device emulation is that it introduces time overhead since emulated operations are slow. Thus, performance is affected.
This is so because in full virtualisation gust OS is not at all modified all itself. Therefor upgrading the version of hypervisor does not lead to any kind of compatibility issue b/w quest OS and hypervisor. And hence upgradation can easily be done.
But in para virtualisation, to reduce the computation burden of the hypervisor same are installed in quest OS. Hence updating the hypervisor might lead to compatibility issue with the quest OS running over it and VM might stop working this creates tight carping b/w VMM and guest OS.
