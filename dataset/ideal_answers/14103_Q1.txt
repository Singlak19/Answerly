a)	1) VM elasticity
It would be important to KI because in cloud computing, one of main features of cloud is the elasticity. As data is not continuously being set to server, resources are being used only when required. Otherwise they are being used for maybe say some other business. As KI is getting charged only when resources are being used i.e. when a near miss or accident clip is sent to the cloud for further analysis, it is being benefited with VM elasticity.
  2)No upfront cost
In context of cloud services used by the KI, these would be no upfront cost. (other costs would be buying conversa and dedicated computing at recording site). Thus, KI need no much upfront cost for getting cloud computing but could pay on as use basis.
3)Reduced maintenance
A part from the computation handled by company, the maintenance handled by       company, the maintenance of storage servers, database, addition and deletion of excess service which they are using.
Thus, reduced maintenance is important for the company as it given them more time to focus on the computation needed in the application.
b)	KI has grown and gave international, soon to cover 75% of world’s big cities.		 Yes, they should build their own private cloud. Reasons for the same are enlisted below: -
1)	To prevent any data leakage or security concerns that exit in public cloud.
2)	Better to invest once in their own cloud than regularly pay to a third party provides.
3)	Can expand their scales without worry of having to inform the public CSP about higher scalability or speed or resource need.
4)	Can customize their resources based on various uses specification as per company’s want.
Hence, they should go for building their own private cloud.
