Paas
( Platform as a service )

suited
model.

it
requires
the
availability
of
infrastructure
and storage services
which
are
catered
by
paas.
Also, laas ?
will
provide a platform
to the
eenup any
to
customise
the
platform
according t
its
needs .
The company

fire to
whichever
classes
&
tasks
it
wants :

benefit
as compared to saas
because
customer

chose any
software

se
for running the
tasks.
Also, it
won't be
bound to use
a
particular
software only which is the case in
saas.
