3 ) The best services model that would be suitable according to me
PAAS ( platform -as a Service ) .
This is so because ,
a) 8&# PAAS would provide the hardware A storage much like IAAS to
stou large amount of data.
1 ) At , the same time PAAS provides development tools, which
can be used by the training company to develop an application
which contains training tasks, classes and thus, the look and the
worklow durgn can be implemented by the company itself.

If the company would have chosen IAAS , only the hardware,
would be available, remaining middlewareand application would be
in Company's control, But kuping in mind company's demand
a stable middleware which is secured by third-party would
be much more berijicial. Thus, PAAS is a better choice then
JAAS .

d) Is SAAS would be chosen the complete application would
be in control of the (SP. The company would have just got 11;
bare minimum admin rights awhich it could use only to distribute
their tasks. Any changes on application according to their
wants couldn't be made. Also, if they think of extending their
application it would be very difficult with development rights
with CSP.
There Jou, SANS would have been a restriction for the company.
Therefore , using PAAS, the company can have secured hardware f
middleware from the CSP on which they can build their application
and modify it according to the need a time ...
