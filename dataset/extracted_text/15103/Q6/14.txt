ANG Health monitoring of the service is important because it tells
how smathely the service is running and whaton we need to take any
remedial
measins
can Paas provides us with a platform which us can use to tat con
Safd ware a deplay an application . The platform come with all the
libraries and tools that will be used to facilitate the deployment
or testing. An example of Platform as a Service can be
mmen Elastic Bean talk or the
Python Anywhere doud platform.
we can use athar of these platforms to deplay am applications
The tale
that can be used to chack Paas health monitoring us
Cloud Trail. Using landTrail ,we can so who has acceral the
platform & when have the changes been made to the platform ..
Using this information we can decide whether we have to take
Some remedial measures .
We can find and when Ik Something
was wras
with
the
application and then wrake the
necen ary change
to the application .
With Inas we get very basic untrostyutuo that we can
work with
We will need to install all the modules a libraries
we want beforo we can start working with the in trastructure
We also have to set up the
type of communication to the
Sewers .
An example
of Iaas is Amazon EC2 .
The Amazon Elastic Computo Cloud ( ECZ ) iprouds us with
on
aparle Jewa that we have to corfuque
to use . The tool that
we can use for monitoring is CloudWatch. Using Cloud watch
we can prow
about the traffic that am server is experiencing
and whether the traffic has reached the
critical threshold.
To im remedy that
problems,we can choose to implanat
lood balene
and
auto-scoder. when
the
traffic reaches a critical
threshold
the
auto- scale will automatically instartiate a new
E C 2
sewa
and
the load balancer will split the incoming
among the multiple EC Z instares
