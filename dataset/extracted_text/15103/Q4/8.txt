4 ) i) Data safe - Data Safety in the cloud is ensured using encryption. Customer's data is nought using private keys held only by them. Also, data is safe from loss by adopting a fault tolerant architetture which involves & creating multiple backups and copies. 11) Can't be accessed by other customers - Using proper authentication and authorisation we ensure data belonging to a partcular user is visible only to him. Also V'M isolation is established, which means other customers can't access your resources even y they are using the same hardware 101 ( il ) Data from getting hacked and stolen - le insure security of data at compute and network layer. We also use a multi-layered defense approach for preventing hacks . This includes physical security of sovers and cloud premises, . security of compute layer i.e. VMs, Sovers hy borwissers etc.; Security of network layer using o forfirewalls and encryption techniques . o loting using proper authentication and access control methods etc. (Iv) Security certificates - Yes ISO 27001 is one such cortificate for eustownn security practices of Information Seccoity Management Systems ( ISMS ) . Also, there are many other 14 privacy and seuwaty standards like PCI-DSS, HIPAA, COBIT etc. ( V ) Cloud security and on-premises security , - @ on-premises security is always more effectue as cloud security as you are only sharing data within your organisation and not will another poteritially Company and their potentens their users. Although, using a multi-layered seuouty approach in the cloud and following industry standards one can almost match the security to on-premise Security.
