4 . a ) What do you do to keep my data safe ? The data stoud in cloud can be ratected using various cryptographic encryptions like ABE based, for eg, KP- ABE, CP-ABE, etc. Thus the data stoud in encrypted form is safe as the decryption lont be allowed to people not having the keys and required attributed. So the data at rest is protected. How do I know data can't be accessed by others? The confidentiality of the data is protected using access control policies. The date in transit is Alcured by authentication + network securities like SSL, TLS, etc. This only authenticated user can access only the data that it is authorized to use + can't access other's data. ( ) Prevent deta from being hecked + stolen ? Authentication and Authorization provided by DAM (Identity and Access management don't let outsiders access or stade the data. Also, encryption and Intrusion Detection System doesn't allowe enternal attacks hacks take place. A ) Sucurity certifications from 3 rd party ? )All the regulatory issues + combliance issues should be prementioned in the contractual papers, either they are related to CSP or the 3rd party, so, all the customers will get to know about security certifications & other compliance beforehand through the contractuel bakers of the CSP e cloud security combared to on-premises security? On - premises is more secure then cloud, as in cloud the resources are shared by multiple customers due to multitenancy. But a lot of security measures all 4 takea like access control, authorization, encryption, etc. But in case there is some very sensitive data, the customer can also be given choice to cowell in private cloud wheres / he will be provided on - premises deta storage for further more security Moreover IT IL of ISO / IEC 27002 takes care of rules of regulation around security issues.
