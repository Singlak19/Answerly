Yes, there are various security certifications from third parties that one can look at like HIPAAC for health related data, ePHI) Or PCIDSS ( during financial transaction ). Also external auditing is done for security and various standards are put he by Systrust ore Webtrust, . On-premise security uses methods like CCTV camera lootages and physical presence of individuals to catch any unauthorised access. In cloud security using authentication systems like multifactoring and + 3 timplement implementing If trailing prechinaism, one can stop mounthowised access at once without presence of people and even catch the culprit. Also on- promise security is costly as compared to cloud seauity.
