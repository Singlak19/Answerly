(Ques 5 . )
. Analyse the sensitivity te risk of users resources
2.9 Virtual Machines (UMs) are perome to attacks,
Say, a company's VMs are compromised,
their resources may be blocked by the
attacker, their storage mgetto hacked,
passwords may get baked, or VMS may
be cumped out by the attacker dr
the resources altbrated to the VIN may
be used by the attacker (mostother for
his /her own benefitt / asc.
Hence, the risk sensitiveity of users
resources is importants
to be known .
Cloud service models require customer to
be responsible for security oft Various
levels of service.
e.g. Paas, Toas, Saas require different
levels of security responsibility from
the customer.
Say a company X opts for Saa's survive
woodel theng has the only the
responsibility of user management ( and
external aud ts, if needed )
whereas in case of Paas it additionally
has The responsibility of securing" the

deployed application on the platform and lastly
in case of Iaas, the CSP only provides the
Infrastructure of the cloud system. Hence,
In addition to responsibility of Saas & Paas,
the customer also needs to responsible
for everything that it has created on top
of the infrastructure and its security like
configuration management, Os stuurity,
network security etc.
Understand the data storage and transfer
mechanim provided by the cloud service
provider .
e.g .
Say a company X has its servers in
Ohio and they want to shift it to
New York, line.transfer it ).
Herce, in such a case it's important
to know how the data was bing stored
in Ohio and, what were the applicable
security standards in Ohio?, whether the
data was encrypted or not ? and
if the data is transferred to New York
what transfer mechanisms will the
CSP will use, stree data in transit
us at risk .
will they physically move the servers
or copy the data to the NY server.

Such important questions should s.
before tranferen an type of data
. Consider proper cloud tybe used
Say a companyX needs a full-fledged
( solution forl CRM ( customer Relationship
Management ) via a CSP.
Hence, They may consider Saas service
(Software as a service) by SALESFORCE
as a potential solution.
Similarly, say company y wants to
have a platform fort
financial reporting
where they can host their in-house
application and it it pericialely. Hence,

can be used with a deployment model

So, it's important to tonerder a proper
cloud service model like Paas
Saas

and
a proper deployment

needs and requirements of the company,
