he responsible for sccmity at various levels of service:
Consider an trouble: - A cloud service is extremely
secue & takes a D3- Jacta authentication!

Sistem. Hacken introducede After getting the
services, Client forgets to logout.

using that system will get access . This illustrated that
the client ( customer ) needs to be responsible.

provided by the cloud service provider -
Cxamble - there s are two cloud services, one
uses encryption while transfering /
storing data other doesn't .
One day the data got leaked, the
