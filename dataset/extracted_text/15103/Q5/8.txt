before moving to' cloud technology ! -
Analysing the secivilly to lisks & users
resources is very important For example,
1:
of our business deals with majorly data,
TOT/
that too sensitive data , & we should think
twice before moving to doid as sharing
ature
resources with others might pose risk to
our dela resources, the Also, if as a client,
Suppose we need more of computing resources,
desavthe sharing can pose a problem and
propen analysts need to be done before going

my As a customer, my responsibility varies with
What type cloud sevice am I going to avail.
For example, in Iaal, the responsibility the,
customer is very high with regards to security
I cloud, the application, the etc. as company/
to Saaby in which the security
the
underlying applications is the responsibility
) the cloud service provider , expect the
access, authorization and -entitlement mangeant
whichhs lies with the client,
IFiels, different types I service models provide

Data storage and transfer techniques are I one
of the major aspects to look for in a
cloud service environment . Data- at- rest
should be protected enough . Various techniques
like encryption on be followed to store the
data. While in transit, secure networks should
be used while transferring data Preferably,
private networks should be used rather than

public networks for funsfersing date, Also,
checksun policies can be used to verify
If the integrity of the data has been
maintained or not the cloud service
provider nest ensure that data is safely
stored, with back-ups available and will be
safely, destroyed

Which type of cloud service should be uno)
need to be decided very carefully . Por
example , if we only need existing application
and don't need any other resources, Sans
model should be availed, or if development
tools are also needed, Paas should be
Qualled, If only infrastructure is required
from outiale , Daal can be availed . Similarly,
based on degree of security required
and cost associated with it, public, private
or hybrid cloud should be choosed
wisely.
