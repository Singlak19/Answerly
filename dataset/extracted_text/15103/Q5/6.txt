Ans-5. 2) Analyse sensitivity to usks- als in auto ww 1) For example, if a user has hosted an supplication on AWS, where the servers are located out in another country , the security policies must be different, and velocity of attack more . 2 ) There would be several factors contributing to risk,"" ., Mo auditing and monitoring , lack of policies-etc. 3 ) jeence users / ouganisation must go through full policies, regulations, SLA, to assess sensitivity of to risks. b ) Chaud service models require customer to the rechonsible at various levels : - 1) For example, consider Iaas. The cloud service proceder would be resposible for protection of infrastructure, and maybe some authorization services . But customer needs to be responsible for database and network security , and application security also. 2 ) ESP is not 100% rechonsible on security aspects. c ) Understand data storage, tranofue mechanism 1) For example, consider e-mail service. The CSP Scanned with CamScanner wreales a demilitined zone ( DMZ) to avoid, external attoacto on datas ly creating a seperate subenet anstvs. Twin 2 ) noughtion techniques (if applied) must be known beforehand . 3) Prior information of these helps in analyses of security and data is at rest or at transit . d ) consider proper cloud type to be used 1) For example, a company dealing with very sensitive information, for example, financial transactions, need to have cloud withich is ip move secure le.g. private cloud ) 2) seme, type of claud also needs to be analysed Scanned with CamScanner
