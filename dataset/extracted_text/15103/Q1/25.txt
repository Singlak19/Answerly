Virtualization is that concept of running

The benefits of virtualization are
- High elasticity
- High scalability
- Better sitilization of resources
- Better risk management.
Para- virtualization, is the type of virtualization

Virtualization is of two types :"
11) Type - like (i ) Type - 2 size
Type - I ky virtualization involves a operating
system running on top of a baremetal
hardware and Type- 2 virtualization involves
involves a operating system running on top
a host operating system which suns on the
server hardware and interacts with it.
Para - virtualization is the type of voitualisation
that has a guest O.S. running on top of
a hypervisor. The quest O.S"is informed
about the fact that it is being virtualy
As a result, the guest O.S short circuits
it's drivers to reduce the overhead envolve
In dealing with the hardware ..

The main drawbacks of para - virtualization are !.
i) It requires the guest O.S to be modiffed.
This is a problem as it is not acceptable
to big vendoers like Microsoft.
, windows can be un on top of another
host D.S. if we are able to find the
appropriate drivers for it to interact with
the hardware.
It is shower ho as compared to full
vwitualization. Since the O.S has to do
a lot of modifications the interact with
the hardware.
