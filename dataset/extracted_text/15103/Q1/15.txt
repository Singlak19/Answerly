need of vatualization
Virtualization refere to the abstraction of underlying.
resources
so that user is not aware of the
bolli Architectone, that actually exists .
Cloud computing refers to the delivery of computing services -
sewers, storage networking, come it's over the internet .
The idea of cloud computing resto heavily on the
concept of vvituolization.
Following key points highlight the need of virtualization :
Resource utilization
Virtualization ensures efficient resource utilization .
A number of VM's can
run on a single Roadware .
If the meed ouses, more instances can lee created
in real - time, so as to ensure, no machine is
under - utilised .
This Insures there is not much lood on a single
pystom as well as no machine is setting ist
sidle state .

Cost
Virtualization brings the cost down significantly .
Resources are being used efficiently through vortuolyation
This ensures less wastege, that is less wostage of
money too, which is usually spent in procuoring
resources .
Also , the " hoy - as - you - go' method ensures
efficient
spending of monetoy resources.
(iii)
Scalability
Dvituolization in cloud computing provides scalobilty to the
users .
A large organization
can use cloud for its
functioning as well as an individual can use it too.
Virtualystion ensures more resources can bee procured on it
requirement crises , without changing much
in the configuration
( v )
Elasticity
evitoolyction also ensures elasticity
of a VM's
utilization reached 80%. mark, a neve VM can bee
setup in red-time to fondle the increasing traffic.
If the traffic decreases ofter that, the new VM can be
discorded. All this hoffens due to vortuolization.

variety of OS on a single hardware -
The hypervisor or virtual machine monitor ( VMM) Rondles
all the VM's present. The VM's are indefendent of
each other and can host different
os in each VM .
This also ensures effective utilisation of available resources.
There are 3 types of virtualization , primarily :
. Full virtualization
. Para virtualization
. Os level virtualization.
some details -
. Bull virtualization - OS is not we're about the fact that
it is being virtualized.
. OS level virtualization - The Ability to handle virtualized envoiomat
a
is Bult into the os.
. Para virtualization - OS is aware that it is gunning in a
voituelyed environment.
Growback of para - vituolization .
Though making the os owore, that is gunning in a
virtual environment reduces the overhead generated dwang
with hypervisor ,
the major drowbeck is
to alter the OS
make it wire .
most os D like windows don't provide
for such changes in OS .
