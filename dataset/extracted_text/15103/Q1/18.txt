Virtualization te is needed to
ensure
efficient usage
of
resources. A single hardware
Component
may not be
foll fully utilizable by
one customer
as it would ericked the storage and compilation
greg werements
of one customer . Using virtuelization we
can distribute the hardware or physical gusowie to
be made usable by multiple users. eg : - In a
cloud Computing
setup , the cloud sovice provider has
longe storage and computation dan hardwares. they
This is~ because
of
economies of scale. For one
mostly
hard disk and one CPU, the requirements of many
customers
can be mel , instead of just one customer .
This
leds to resource poding , and efficientuse of
resources
and
reduced costs. Virtualization also
allows
for larger
possibilities
configurations of
a they customer's setup eg . - A user has the
option to chose cheese his ofcrating system and &storage
From
teguruments according to his need instead of selecting
a pu-difined category .

Para- vertualization requires
the Guest os aned to
of
a particular configuration that is
related
to
the hypervisorand hestos . Also , it
regvous configuration
of quest IS that allows
change un
it
to respond to system API calls. This means
that
profrietory OS like Windows can't support
Operating systems
para virtualization. Open source like Linux Xen
can support paravirtualisation
Para virtu alization
also introduces
a dependency on the current setup
withen doing Vm migration, the new setup should have
the Same configuration as the orginal one and
the quest os
should be compatible with
hypovisor and hestos .
