IS ( in some cases ) yram the quest operating
asystem or
Virtual Machines ( VM )
Need of virtualization ! !
. Guest operating systems think that they are the
only not being virtualized & Dove only OS of VM
hasting, the giving VM isolation .
Mooie OHiciency is achieved when a single hardware
resource
is being used to provision multiple
virtual machines .
( Hiding )
Abstracting the architechture details
of resources from quest OS leads to a much better
version in terms of security.
Cast is reduced by using csingle resource for
serving multiple visitual machines.
Thus virtualization makes osure that the best
security is given to guest operating osystems.

In para- vivitualization, quest OS are aware of the
fact that they are being visitualized.
Drawbacks of para-virtualization!!
. A heavy cupdation is grequired to modify quest
Operating systems in order to function
properly
with host OS or hardware resources .
Docect communication with underlying gresouwices can
lead to coompting
the
resources which can
further
destroy or hijack another virtual machines
. Para - virtualization does not seem appealing
to
large vendors & including Microsoft, because A the
need to change default configurations.
