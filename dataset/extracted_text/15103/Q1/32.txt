Virtualization is the process of logically
running multiple systems on a single
physical server / system with proper isolation
and management of the individual systems.
We need virtualization because of the following
mentioned reasons :
( 1) Increased Efficiency ,
We can create several logically independent
systems on a single machine this increasing
the efficiency of cloud computing by many
folds .
( 2) Easy Management of Systems:
All the systems allocated to the user by
the cloud Service Provider can be controlled /
managed from a single, place , hence
the
system are easily manageable .
( 3)
Scalability:
The user can achieve nearly infinite amount of
scalability in a matter of minutes time

all because of
virtualization as haul
the cloud Service Provider can run several
logical systems on a single physical machine.
(4) Does not hamper performance:
Virtualization enables the Cloud Service Provider
to run several logical systems on a single
machine but
in this process there
is
no trad with the performance as
virtualization requires vory lis computation
power .
( 5) Keeps Services cost-effective :
Because of Virtualizationi , many cloud
Service Providers like EAWS, Azure achieve
Economies of scale with many millions
if customers hence the cost of services
is very nominal .
-- Virtualizationn in a system is carried out
by a firmware / software called " the
Hypervisor or the Virtual Machine Monitor ( VMM).

there are 3 types of virtualization which are
as follows:
( 1 ) full virtualization :
In this type of virtualization, all the Guest
which are present on the Host machine are
unaware
that virtualization is taking place
and are also unaware of the multitenancy.
In this all the instructions are translated
On the fly- EgalEL
(2) Para - virtualization :
In this type of virtualization , the Guests
know
about the virtualization and the multitenancy ,
hance they modify their Guest Operating System so
as to reduce the overhead and keep in sync
with the host operating System / Hypervisor.
( 3) Os level Virtualization :
In this there is no Hypervisor involved the Guest
Operating System is modified in such a way
that Virtualizationi takes place . But here
all the Guest OS and Host Of must have
Same OS. Eg: Solari's Containers.

The draw backs of paravirtualization are af
follows :
( 1) compatibility Issues:
As the quest os needs to be modified so
as to integrate it with the Most DB , there
high level of
needs to be compatibility between
the
V
quest as and the host os.
(2 ) Tight Dependency:
Im Para- virtualization the guest OS , the
host of and the hardware are modified
and there is a light dependency between
all these components.
