NEED OF VIRTUALIZATION
1.
Virtualisation helps in creating virtual systems
For each user by providing a common
hardware platform and allocating resources
to each system from the same, using a
Virtual Machine Monitor or Hypervisor.
2 .
It helps in achieving less energy and time
is now we need not allocate seperate
severs to each quest OS. it is achieved on
oa common hlatform
3. It also helps in reducing the costs due
to similar reasons of less expenses on
operate hardware.
4. Increased efficiency is also achieved as
multiple guest OS are catered to at the
same location.
5. Since the services are not widespread
now, hence the chances of attack sce
also reduced as the area of network is
lesser.

6. Herice, it reduces of using extensive
firewalls and protection techniques

Para - virtualization :-
1) Para virtualization needs a specific API
To be implemented for exchange of instructions
between os and hypervisor to fulfil the
requirements.
2 ) This implementation needs alteration ar
modification of the quest OS , for API to
run successfully.
3 ) This is a disadvantage as the system
Hrorders will not be attracted to such
a virtualization technique which alters the
Os without comment.

4) Also, all the operating systems are not
comportable to generate the API calls and
hence, are non-functional in this ritua-
lisation technique. of Microsoft Windows .
5 ) lince, it not very advantageous in certain
scenarios.
