Ans 1 Virtualization is needed in place where the hardware Cannot be seperated or limited Virtualization basically allows many Of (operating Systems) to work simultaneously on the some hardware without interfering Vistualization is used in cloud and it help CSP's to provide specific amount of space and computing pawns they want thus allocation becomes easier. It is also used by people who want two 0.S to nun on this computer or personal desktop viatualization makes cloud computing feasible and seduces the cost of processing virtualization is classified Detype 'E Type @@full () para 2 0- S level Type 1 in. hype I there is no ber host os , nypushson / nyprovided in. typed here is allocales the mepourrait choll O'S an which hypervisor is installed Chase os. ] Scanned with CamScanner full in, full virtualization the Gerst Os are isolated and donot know they they are running on virtual machine para :. the software in modified in such a way that the VMs are aware of being virtualized.
