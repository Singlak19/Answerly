Virtualization is the abstractions of hardware recourses from the
system. Virtualization allows you to utilize hardware resources to full
capacity by running one or more virtual machines on a hardware
platform .
The organisation need not be concerned with the purchase of machinery
like systems and servers as the CSP is responsible for the
physical infrastructure.
There is no need to spend on the maintance of the same .
Round the clock access to the VM is available.
"You can use as much os as less as you need . You can scale up
or down by only a few minutes notice.
Para virtualization is the form of virtualization in which the a virtual
machines, are aware of being virtualized which at some level defeats the
idea of virtualization .
"The operating systems are modified so as the integrate with the
hypervisor better . However , if an update is to be made in the hypervisor
on the hardware platform , the task becames more tedious as all
@ the VMs I need to be updated.
As the VMs are not completely isolated , the security concerns in
paravirtualization are greater as in full virtualization .
Unlike full- virtualization, the VMs can not run on different operating
systems . The OSs need to be same .
