Aly 1. Virtualization is a technique of pooling various hardware
Mesouces of a physical machine so that various Operating
Systems can un upon a single physical machine .
Virtualization is made possible by a component
called as the "Hypervisor. Hypervisor translates
calls ( hypercalls ) from a quest os to Host OS OL
native instructions.
with virtualization, we use the physical resources to
a greater efficiency as more operations can be performed
De a single machine . Virtualization offers initunal
loss in processing speed and hence we do not observe
performance issues . With Virtualization , it is possible
to un processes in isolation. without them affecting
other processes and hardware, thus increasing security
of the system .
For eg: If a tester wants to win an application, but
is afraid of its malicious bitentions, he may opt to

execute it in a virtualized emmiecoment.
with virtualization, it is possible to um OS with
different architecture on a single machine . These days ,
hypervissers allow us to win windows, Linux, Solaris,
etc ., all on one system,
Virtualization cair be adrieved on 3 levels :
- Full virtualization
- Para virtualization
- DS - level virtualization
In pana virtualization , the Guest os is made awam that
the DS is being virtualized. Doing so may result in
Shout ciminiting of hyperdrivens to gain performance .
However, not all OSis support such kind of modification
For. eg: Microsoft windows is one of the most used OS in
the would, but, due to its proprietary nature, it does!
support OS modification to achieve para virtualization.
