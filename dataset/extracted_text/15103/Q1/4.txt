Need of virtualization .: -
1 . Resource Utilization ; -
- Virtualization helps in resource utilization as there is
no dedicated hardware for Virtual Machine. T.
Any hardware which is available at the moment
Can be used.
- This helps in optimum utilization of Resources.
2 . quest System Independent :-
I In virtualization the Guest system is generally
Kept free from any host overheads.
- As a result quest system runs independtly A just
enjoys the service provided without caring about
The mechanism behind .
3. Increases Availability
-> Availability is the mayor requirement of any cloud
Computing Service .
- Since, virtualization isefue is independent of the
quest system. The there are no dedicated.

User can logis from any system of can
access the data.
For example : - To access the data on cloud (Aws )
the user just needs to login irrespective
the system .

6 . Easy to Increase Decrease Resource Required
The virtualization helps in increasing or
decreasing
the resources whenever required.

For example: if the load is move during festivals,
One can order more resources .
Draw backs of para- Virtualization
On
1. Restriction Chuest OS
- In para virtualization the quest os needs to be
Configured according to the need.
This puts be limitation of the type of os that
Can be introduced .
2 . Adding / updating Drivers :-
In para virtualization special Drivers need to be
Fimstalled so that the Communication between the quest
& hypervisor is smooth.
I These Drivers becomes an overhead for the Cavest.
3 . Change in Hypervisor propogated to Cruest OS :-
- The Curest Os is aware about the fact that it is being
virtualized .
-,
when ever their is cabdate / change in the hypervisor.
The evest os need to be updated accordingly,

4. Resouce Overhead for Client ( Guest OS )
- The quest os converts the intevation in a
form that is understood by the hypervisor carily
o- In order to do so, the Os needs to have
Some extra space to save tables & payon this

tramolation.
