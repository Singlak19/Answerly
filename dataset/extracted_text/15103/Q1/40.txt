1. Need of virtualization : multitenancy : mekes As the cloud provides multitenancy, it kedeta of Systems of different tenent's share the same physical resources . But they require diff. OS, so a large no. of LOSs Or vintual machines are required. 2- Increasing Utilization : As only one on one machine westes a lot of hardware resources, virtualization helps in utilizing the ressources by making virtual machines use them in baradded with isolation from each other, preventing idle state of PU . 3- Scalability : Due to herge scalability provided by the CSP, it requires large number of available machines / containers. As the hardware is difficult to scale, selebility is achieved using virtualization I logical isolation of The machine to use A number of virtual meching /Oss on the same machine & resources . Z Scanned with CamScanner Drawback of have - virtualization : As guest OS short- circuit its divers to deduce overhead, it directly communicate with VMM. or hypervisor . Thus making quest OS aware of virtuelization and causing threats: The dipendency of guest OS + VMM our each other increases . version compatibility sissues arises due to dependency The guest OS needs to be compatible with UMM, which popular Is like Microsoft windows are not. API needs to be introduced in OS to make config changes in order to enable fare - virtualization, this increase security threats Scanned with CamScanner
