Virtualization is nothing but
abstraction over physical resources to make
them shareable.

There are many benefits of virtualization, which
are stated below . .
Virtualization minimizes the overall cost
as multiple virtual machines CVMs) are
hosted on a single server ..
(ii )
virtualization saves time.
(iii)
virtualization : save energy
Virtualization helps to increase resource
(iv )
utilization and hamles resources can be
used
efficiently
( II) virtualization increases productivity.
- There is a software which is responsible for

virtualization ,
which is known as Hypervisor ,
virtualization Manager.
It creates a virtual ( not real )
version of the machine which utilizes the
resowies . There are 3 types of Virtualization;-
( 1)
Full virtualization
( ii )
Para virtualization
Cili )
OS ( operating system level) virtualization.
In case of full virtualization, the quest operating
System doesnot know that it is being modified.
They are completely independent and unaware of
other virtual Machines. Ex: of Full virtualization
are VMWare, VirtualBox. you can have one
server having windows running on it and other
having Linux running on it.
In case of operating system (05)
level
virtualization, there is no hypovisor
at all. The guest operating System directly
interact with the hardware. The drawback
of this virtualization is that all the operating
Systems must be running on same processos.
In case of para- virtualization,
it overcome the drawback of full virtualization.
In this case, the operating system knowes
that it is being modified, as a result their
is a direct dependency between hypervisor and
Scanned with CamScanner
operating system. As a result, the hypervisor
might short circuit itself and can anable the
interaction with operating system, EX- XEN
The drawback of para virtualization
is that some operating system provider
does not allow their os to be modified.
for example, the Microsoft's operating system
ine windows doesnot allow to be modified . As
a result, the OS would not be modified

Which will "inable the interaction between
Guest operating system and Hypervisor.
Because the primary condition for para.
virtualization is the modification of the
operating system.
