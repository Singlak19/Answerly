Ques 1
Virtualization is basically an abstraction of physical resources
than can be shared by a number of virtual machines.
Vistual machines
Virtualization
( Abstraction )
Physical resources
The physical resources that will be shaved bet among virtual
machines is called " host " .
The Operating system sunning on vritual machines is called
ilest Operating system (OS ) "
Hypervisor or vmm is basically a hardware, software or
Middleware framework that help in virtualization or we can
say an interface between physical resources" and vwritual
machines .
. Hypervisor helpis in creating an environment for vitual machines
that is same like original computing envisonment ie vistual
machines are unaware that they are viatualizazed and shared
the physical resoluaces with other leactual machines .
In worst case senesio of hypervisor os vmm, they create only
minor Speed problems in virtualization.

Need of Villadization :-
a) Resource booking:-
Posa -
With the help of virtualization, ist is possible that physical
The
resources like database, servers, Storages etc are shased
Syster
among mose than one machine. in some particular type
itspou
of virtualization, even vistual machines are even unaware
pl
that they are sharing acsouacs with other machines .
b )
Consolidation ! -
wode
It help in consolidation of hardware resources with
drivers
virtual machines . In base hypervisor, there is no host operating
System and hypervisor works as a consolidate between
Guest c
hardware resources and vistual machines .
Like Xe
c )
Isolated machines ! -
Th Even in vistualization, virtual machines act as an isolated
machines because hypomisos creates an environment that
ulatual machines thinks that it is living, physical resources
.only .
d)
Jucrease Efficiency ! -
Physical resources are shared alloug so many viudual machines
the because of that, physical resources are properly utilised
and used. At increases the efficiency of physical resources.

Pasa - Viotualization : -
The major drawback of full virtualization us that guest operating
System are unaware about virtualization which increases
responsibility on hypervisor , because of that , speed and efficiency
of physical resources decreased.
In Para - virtualization , quest operating system are modified and
made aware about vistualization . Guest operating system
drivees interact with hypermisos drinces and help in vintialization ."
Guest operating system us modified so that it is interacting
with - AP ) and helps the hypermisos in virtualization.
Like You hypervisor is summing on Linux OS.

Drawbacks of Pasa- Vistualization
O
- Modified Gulest opesaling system
TOI
ot
-
Mayor vendoss like Microsoft etc do not agree to modify
a
operating system.
-
It increases depandancy between hypomisos and guest spesating
system .
- Due to dependency, & make it vulnerable for various
attacks .
