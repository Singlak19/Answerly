Virtualization is abstraction over physical hardware
inorder to sun multiple VMs on a single hardware .
It is needed for following reasons =>
. Cost A resource effectiveness increases by the use of
virtualization, by sunning multiple V.MS on single hardware
. Jnorder to manage resources
more effectively .
. for prevention of data loss .
Para virtualisation is a type of virtualisation in which the
quest O. S is made realised that it is being run in
Virtual environment inorder for quest O.S to short circuit
Some of its drivers to reduce aveshead of communication
with Hypervisor.
But it has its drawbacks suchas =>
Guest Operating system needs to be modified inaider
to run in a paravirtualised environment . Guest OS has to
be compiled in such a way that it contains APIs capable
of exchanging hypercalls with paravirtualised
hypervisor .
. Another drawback of it is tight dependency of quest as
on hypervisor .
Excess of communication between Guest IS hypervisor.
create vulnerabilities which can be exploited
to attack the system.
