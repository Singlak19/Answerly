Need & virtualization
1. Proper resource utilization
Using virtualization, mony virtual machines will be able to use
the resources available with the lost and therefore there will
be proper utilization of resources that would remain unused if
only a single UH used them.
2. Multi - tenancy :
Using virtualization, we can allow multiple users
to
get access
of different VMs simultaneously. He
The hypervisor
can ensure that data &
one UM is not accessible to the other
VHc even though they are located on some hardware.
3 .
tabblity
Using virtualization, we can dynamically allocate and evoke esources
from any UM as is
required
for their processing needs. So,
ilany
vit has continuos resource utilization over a
set limit ,
Dit
its resources will be increased so that there are no issues
in the functioning of the UN.
4 . UM Migration
Using virtualization, a vit can be migrated from one physical
device Lto another without providing kindrance in its usablity .
This is specifically usefull in case of scaling, Machine failures
etc .

Drawback & paravirtualization
1 . Any OS that is to be used on a UH has to be
modified and made to accept the special APIs designed by
host !
2 . As many large OS companies like microsoft elc ar not.
do not profer modifying their operating system, they are not
available
for para-virtualization . Hence , there is limitation of
option .
3 . The paravirtualization setup will not work it there is any
update in version of the questos or the lost. Hence, both
need to be in sync at all times.
