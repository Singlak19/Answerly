Vintualization is
nothing
but abstraction
over
perupsical
Resources
Virtualization helps
us
different machines
ou
a

Us
to
physical
device
and hence enables
make
efficient
use of resources .
The user
cannot
distinguish
between a vintualized mmachine
and
one
running separately.
Pooling
to gether of resources
Virtualization
helps
us to
combine and use
resources present at
different locations
as
one
servea .
This pooling
together of
resources helps us
with
computing power & an ability
to handle a larger
network load .

Virtualization
helps us achieve economics of

we are able to

Drawbacks of para - virtualization
Para virtualization involves.
making each OS guest
0 peuating system
alvare
that it is being
virtualized .
This
increases the speed as
via
each instruction
is not wouted by the hypervisor.
However, it results in drawbacks such as:
Modification
in
quest OS of each machine
All
quest operating systems need to be modified to
accomodate para Virtualization.
Not suitable for major vendous like microsoft
Microsoft Hyper I does not alloww parquintualisation. This is
problematic
and we need to write a lot of extra code to
make it work
updates
wheneyell
Host DS is updated on
quest Os is updated ,
it mequiries repetitive testing
and refactoring code
Writing APIS :
APls have to be wwitten on
both
W
the quest os side and the Host Hypervisorn.
security vulnerabilities :
since some instructions
byposs
the
hypervisore,
a malicious VH
could take control of eutime system.
