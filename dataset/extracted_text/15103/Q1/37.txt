Ques 1.) Need of Virtualization
In a cloud computing environment, physical
Servers with high amount of storage form the
foundation of cloud servers.
The base of cloud computing is that multiple
users / tenants use a servir and its resources.
Simultaneously with other users / tenants.
So, as a result there's a need to separate
the user's logically so that they can use their
own independent machines without interfering
with each others storage and other resources.
. These logical separations are done using the
concept of witwales ation which"states that
m resources of the physical seeweers can be
wateralused and separate vitual machines
can be created, which exactly mirror the
physical server and its resources.
. These wrtual machines (VMs) can be assigned
to multiple users ( each user gets one VM) and
all the resources of the physical servier are
Shared among VMS and Vlhence; greater
amount
utilisation
of efficiency and resource
is achieved using virtualisation.

Virtualisation has 3 types -
A. Full witualisation
B. Para Virtualisation
C. OS-level witualisation
these types of virtualisation are required to be
Deployment
actieved dependery upon the needs of the cloud
system .
Drawback of Para-Virtualisation
Service
1 . ) In case of Para- witualisation, UMS are
aware that they are being witralised since
The quest O dwwerks and hypervisors
drivers work in cooperation. (I
This has a major drawback this
as

OS-hypowekkers co- operation open up a
withorability of being compromised
If a VM get's comprarused by an attacker,
then the whole hypervws or is at the eusp
of getting compromised due to above mentioned
enerability.
So, its a trade-off between performance
improvement ovver full witcalisation with
the enhanced I increased eusk off the VM or
The hypervisor getting comprothisad.
