Anda Virtualization is a process of providing an abstract layer over
the hardware so that more than One Operating System
Can be operated on that Hardware.
We need Virtualization due to the following reasons: ~
(i) Cost Minimication or Low Cost : - Using Virtualization
more than one operating system can be installed on a
Commen hardware. Thus, with the same cost of
hardware we can enjoy multiple Operating Systems.
Resource Utilization : Proper retourle
utilization is love by sublettry virtualized
Systems to different users via the internet,
(Tic) Base of cloud Computing+ All the cloud
Comforting services are bafed on virtualization.
iv )
Coexistence of tifferent OSes in same system ir
Develfers, sometimes, grequire different to operating
systems in a simple machines for various jourportes.
Virtualization resolves this issue.

Drawbacks off para- virtualization are : -
HA Latency is since, each operating system is a wie
of the presence of other operating systems, an extra
instruction overhead is generated while modifying .
the Oses for para-virtualization. Due to to this
instruction overhead, a delay is observed while whing .
para - virtualized obenating systems.
ii ) 2 Need of Modified Operating Systems I- Since, each
operating system is made awave of the beresence of
other OSes, they need to be modified first in order
to work pooperly in para - virtualized environment.
Raw of Unmodified Ofes Cannot function in para-
vistualized environment, e.g. Microsoftis windows
does not support para virtualization .
