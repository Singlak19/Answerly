Ane. Virtualization, in Cloud Computing, is defined as a logical.
building up of many virtual machines over a single hyburvisor

hypervisor. The need of virtualization arises from the
need of sharing of resources among various clichts of
a cloud service providue, since it will be very difficult to
arrange the resources you all clients without sharing ,
i.e, single tenancy is very costly fou a CSP when
the peak demands of their useas will heat. It will
be very much impossible for asts to arrange resourcey
you all. so, to avoid wastage of resources and to
be able to provide enough resources to useks, at
required, It's the concept of virtualization is
needed in Cloud Computing. Edit
As discussed that the VMs virtualized over a

hypervisor may or may not be aware of presence
of other VMs , based on this fact, virtualization can
be of two typer, cithere full virtualization on para
virtualization. If VMs are unaware ofvirtualization
it is called full virtualization and if we are
aware of each other , then it is para virtualization.
The main drawback that arises in para- virtualization
is that the VM need to be modified in order
to be compatible to run aloy (with each othercn ..
This modification is a big hurdle in this mode
of virtualization being widely and because
in full virtualization, it can be easily implemented
by simply installing neee Of an VMs. The modification,
so done help in Ms to adjust to environment
knowing that the other VM, are also present
and are computing you resources.
