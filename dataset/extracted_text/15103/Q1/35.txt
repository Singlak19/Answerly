AD There is a need of virtualization for operation efficiency and sharing resources. Virtualisation makes it possible to have multiple quest OS running on one host machine. It is done via a VMM or Hypervisor which ack as an interface to the hardware and operating system. guest just quest os OS OS Middle ware - Virtualisation Hypervisor Layer Hardware The need for virtualisation is ! 1 ) Resource Pooling : Resources are shared among differ - ent users with minimum affect to the processing speed of the system . Scanned with CamScanner TAO COLLEGE IDEEAIR ( 11 ) Multitenancy: Different users can access public data from various locations of the world and use it. ( 11) Security : It's more secure as compared to information being kept at one place, cause in case of privacy breach, the data can be tampered or misused but if it's stored and being worked upon different machines, the daten remains safe ( IV ) UM Migration : It helps in moving data from one CSP to another without shutting down the system. For eg. Load Balancing etc. ( U ) VM Isolation: The virtual machine thinks that it " " owns " the hardware of the system and beleve . no other machine is using that resource thus , behaves in isolation , Drawbacks of Para- Virtualisation: 11) you have to modify the OS. 111) Cannot work with big time players like Windows is compatible with inux.
