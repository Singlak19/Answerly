Virtualization is basically abstraction over physical resources so
multiple users can use the physical resources optimally. I'm
Virtualization a virtualization layer comes between operationg
System and the physical hardware.

There are many benefits of virtualization which explains why it
is needed in today's world :-
1. Resource Utilization- Virtualization is responsible for creating
Several virtual machine over a single, real, physical machine.
So, when many virtualized machines are running on a
real hardware then the resources are utilized optimally. There
are very less chances of all machines sitting in idle state.
2 .
Migration is Easy ! - Developers need to update their application
sometimes and after updating the application they need to
push their changes in the production. So without shutting
doon the machine, they can migrate their virtual machine
to a new hardware & they can push their changes easily.

3 Cost effective : - As many virtual machines seen on a single.
physical machine, the cost of using a UM also reducey
Also when a user feels the need of more resources , the
CSP can easily create more VM for them.
# Drawbacks
of para-virtualization '-
1. change in OS: - To make the operating system compatible
with Hypervisors, developers need to work hard on the
development of updated us . For companies like Microsoft
it is not possible to make changes in their OS for
para - virtualization .

2 .
Security issues!- As the updated OS make direct calls
to the hardware via hypervisor APls , there is a risk
to the other Vitual machines because the affected VM
Can corrupt the whole computing system. Also the VM's are
aware of the presence of each other, so it can cause
damage to alt the hardware.
