2.) Cloud Computing Architecture
A basic to cloud computing Architecture has the followme
Components : -
1.) Physical Hardware ( Servers)
This refers to the physical location where all
files of the network are stored.
. The sites where hardware is stored are called
data centres ,
ii . ) Hypervisor ( UMM ).
. A virtual machine manager ( UMM), also called a
hypervisor, controls the different withial machines
that hun oh a system.
Ww quest os .
A guest OS is the virtualized operating system that
Is running on a virtual machine.
. It is the operating system ags on which a load
User works.
j v , Middleware
. Hiddleware refers to all intermediary tools that
a user uses an a cloud platform to either develop
their own application or th process data.
. This includes programining languages, JDES, data
visualisation software etc.
. For P.g.1 Javey Tableau ek.
LW Applications.
" These are the softwares ( developed in-house of
licensed ) that Run on the system.
. Applications are the end result of using cloud
computing.
. tras directly Consumers directly interact with
applications and applications, in turn, send messages
to servers and carry out tasks.
