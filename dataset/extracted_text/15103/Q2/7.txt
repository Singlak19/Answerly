Quese Cloud Computing Architecture: Diagram : Requirementy Multitenancy Flexibility Scalability any other Suvice Mode Iaas Paas Saas Public Private thy brid Deploymead Communit Models cloud Cloud Cloud Cloud Requirements of Cloud Computing - Multitenancy : The cloud must be able to service. multiple users dising the same physical resources. I Scalability: The user should be able to scale the recources like servers (VMs), storage etc quickly. - Flexibility: The user should be able to change the eusoureop easily a quickly. Elaricing Deployment Modele : 1. Public Cloud: The resources are shared by various users. This leads to less security but cofot effective resources 2 . Private Cloud : In this model , the cloud is private to an organisation de remains in the organisation's premises. Only the private data is stored on this cloud which makes it more secure. 3. trybeid Cloud : In this model , the # cloud inherits advantages of both public e private cloud. for less zo data with less security requirements public cloud is used de for sensitive data, private cloud is used. 4. Community clid : In this model, multiple organisation pool their resources to create a common cland fora certain set of users. Hence, is called community cloud. Service Models :. a 1 . Infrastructure as A Service (Iaas) : In this model, user gets access to physical resources (VMs, databases) which are maintained by the cloud provider. Eg:-Amazon EC2 2. Platform As A Service ( Paas): In this model, user gets access to the platform with computing resources, dwelopment tools andmai which can the need to develop applications while the cloud provider maintains physical resources like VMS de databases. Eg: Awe Lambda. 3. Software As A Service ( Saas) : In This model, user is provided with the complete application for use and everything is maintained by the CSP. Egg E-mail.
