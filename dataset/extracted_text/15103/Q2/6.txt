A good cloud computing Architecture must be able to
Sonne its clients , that could be organizations on individuals
in a reliable and secure mannen . Some of the
concepts of CC architecture from the diagram can be
highlighted below :-
1) Data at rest :
This is the storage aspect of cloud computing. storage
must be encouppted and follow security protocol to
avoid loss of data to unathouized personel . Data
must also have integrity.
2 ) Data in motion : -
Transiting data must also be encrypted hond must be
transmitted over secure channels such as SSI and
TLS. Mining up of data and loss of data during transit
must also be avoided.
3 Servery : -
Scalability is an essential part of cloud computing.
the CSP's must ensure that sevens are up and
eumining at ( ally times so that user experience in
sunooth, without any trouble
-
4 ) Security : -
This could mean both , internal and external security.
Internal security could be provided by by installing
Firewall
and Identity Access and Management
Schermes.
esteunal on Physical security can be provided by
saffguarding the locations of sevens and monitoring
the service centre.
6) Seperation between Users : -
It is very important that requests between usus don't
get missed up, hence, a good identity management
scheme is required, fuor staut to frwish of a service,
to ensure seperation between users.
- A good cloud computing Architecture can provide
various services to itx clicnt such as Software as a
Sevice (SAAS), PAAS, IAAS, etc.
