All the cloud computing services available have a basic
architectine which is atown above. The most indomentary
thing it contains is the hardware. This includes processor,
network bandwidth, storage, memory ( RAM) and input and outpid
& These are the usthat form the basic stack ton
components
which the UM M ( virtual Machine Monitor ) would treen. These
should robust enough to handle the road of all the VHA
that are reun on it. Also, harcreare security is essential too.
Then we have the hyperisos which is rrun atop this
hardwareok atop an OS installed on the hadware. This
hypervisor is responsible for, instruction translation of the
application running in the UM, UM security, UM isolation at
resource allocation to the applications running in the UN out
off their allocated quota and decoupling the application from
the host OS. Wherever we request a cloud service for a
I system we are allocated one of the vMs hu by the
hypervisor. This system feels as if it has the complete
control over the system.
Atop the hypervisor run the VMs, On a single physical
machine there can be a number of VMS running over it .

Each UM
is isolated, independent + unquale of the
presence of the other UMA. It has its own set of virtual
resources ( that it emulates ) like storage , network betalde ,
processor so that the application + Of are unaware that they
are not running a real server. Virtualization of resources helps
in a no. of advantages like it better management of
systems with lesser sepadmins, better resource utilization,
multi-tenancy, etc. VMs" can be migrated from one
physical machine for another as long as the
microprocesor remains same.
The applications that run in a UM can be anything
and can be installed
by I managed bby the user
( Paas) or
provided by the CSP (cloud service
provider) as a service ( Saas ). If the user has
control over the infrastructure and network aspects,
it then becomes on IcaS service model.
Depending on have the cloud is deployed it can
be public cloud , private cloud, hybrid cloud or a
community cloud.
