Hno 2 Access 17 V. V 2 1 V3 Vy Access VS INTERNET Vic Vi2 VIM User Virtual Machines ( virtualized ) Resource from H/ W CLOUD COMPUTING/ ARCHITECTURE A cloud computing System is nothing bout a virtual machine provided over the internet, to a user to behave like a namal physical machine. This process is known as abstraction ( the user doesn't get to see the real working behind the scenes ). At CSP's end > A cloud service provider will have a pool resources like Storage, or RAM or other system specs. He will then create virtual machine out of the resources as per the requirement of the user who subscribed to its services Once the virtual machine is created, it is temo thi uses is given remote access credentials, If anytime a uses required more resources than assigned or less resources than assigned, he can make a request to the P-CSP who will then increase / decrease system Capabilities of the virtual machine. The uses will. Charges as per the usage. The CSP has the responsibility to manage and take care of the virtual machine provided, At User's end, A user will use the remote access credentials to access to this virtual machine os service and use it as he Sees fit without having to take care of its security, maintainance of physical hardware. This is abstraction. All these services are exchanged over a network, be it be a LAN as WAN. Secure protocols like SSL os TLS are used for exchange of information and may os may not include encryption.
