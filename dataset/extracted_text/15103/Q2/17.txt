The fiest low tells about various deployment models,
ie how Cloud is maintained & where it is located :.
Public- A public cloud is shared by multiple customers
vrespective of their needs or services they'll be using it for
. Private - A private cloud is exclusive to one organization and is

. Jaas: - Jaas provides,
hadware gresources such as UM,
Database, and customes worries about other resources
to make & an application .

The third slow tells about the various attributes
associated with a cloud :-
Multitenancy :. When multiple tenants are hosted on a cloud
gresousice, it is timed as multitenancy giving a
cheaper Sovice of cloud computing.
. Latency:- Latency is defined as amount of time a cloud
takes to execute the siequest " provide the
gregpissed service to the user.
