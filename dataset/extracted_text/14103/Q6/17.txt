comey
with .
A virtual system that

with scalability and flexibility
the Cloud Computing
For an event like Cyber Monday in the US,
where poole I customer traffic online increases exponentially
overtime and
comes to normed the next day ; you need
a service for which you pay exactly for how much
time
the
resources are used . This is provided by
Cloud Computing and that's why it must have been
an
ideal
storage and processing space for China and
us for
Single's Day and Cyber Monday respectively
Therefore
-
infininte scalability
LV
flexibility
pay for what used
Those Features
Cloud Computing explains why
possibly
it
way invented
for these days, There is
no '
intorription or lag in cloud computing service every
of
the
load
becomes 10 times
and charge is
over resources used
rather
than
the time duration
for which they are replenished .
