Ans6: This statement by Kamal is somewhat True.
A major advantage which cloud services provide
is auto- scaling and pay-as - you-go. Before
cloud computing, organisations have to guess the
infrastructure requirements and often end up
under-prepared or over-prepared. This has
further serious implications cost and customer
satisfaction .

with cloud computing, organisations can
subscribe to different plans according to their
needs . So, for e.g .
Alibaba can increase the
infrastructure capabilities during " Single's Day
in China " and pay extra only for that day.
This makes operations more flexible &
cost - effective.
