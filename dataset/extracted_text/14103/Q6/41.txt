Ques 6 ..
Elasticity and scalability of cloud computing
are the reasons due to which it is live.
Scalability ? It means increasing the number
of servers with the increase in demand. Fr
example of CPU liberation is more than
80%, then it will add more servers
automatically.
S )
Elasticity ? It means increasing or Decreasing
depending upon the demand of CPUutilization
is more than 80%%, then new severs will
be added, if cpu utileration is less than
2op , then CPU utilization will be reduced .
The advantage are +
( i) Effective resource utilization? Resources
are not wasted , otherwise, of there is
initial capacity fixed, then ether we may

end up with limited resources or excess recours.
") more cost Effective since company don't have to
Buy thisel ouen infrastructure, hardware or
machines, it actually gives cost benifer to the
company.
Feel") no maintenance :- since maintenance of infrastructure
is responsibility of cloud service pronder
company need not wary about its maintenance
issue. they can focus on its operational activities
