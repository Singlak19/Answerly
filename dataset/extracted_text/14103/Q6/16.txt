Ques 6 Based on the special shopping day scenario, it is obvi ous
that when the sales, or shopping day strikes, the users
for that particular company increases tremendously.
And hence for such a tremendous increase there
comes responsibilities because such increase can be handled,
1 ) If number of customers are increasing on the shopping
or sales day, it will become hard for company to
install hardware servers for each increase slot. Hence
cloud computing provides the servers which are accessible
on cloud and increases with increase in demand.
2) Multiple users can be supported because of multitenancy
attorbule ofcloud computing and hence many renants
can be handled at any time.
3 ) for the increasing customers, the load on softwareie.
cloud increases and hence Load-Balancing is done
for such increase so that the service at any
point doesnot slop and become unavailable.

cloud computing model.
2) Even if there are multiple users, the data and credenting
of each user is protected and separate from rest of the
