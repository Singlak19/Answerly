High volume shopping days in the e-commerce
industry very precisely present the case for the
advent of cloud computing . Having actually
interned
at an e- commerce company in India,
I myself can vouch for the volume that enundates
through on such occassions for e.g. at the bi-anual
EORS at Myntra, the Not. of customers during
these 3 - days of sale are
even
100 times the
volumes that the sewers experience on an average
day in the year. To mitigate such sort of requests ,
the infinite scalability along with elasticity and
5)
pay was- you - go policy of cloud computing comes
to the verque. Therefore, to be able to handle
business which is 100 to 1000 times an average day,
infrastructure capacity needs to
be scaled accordingly
Cloud Computing may have been a theoretical concent
before e-commerce , but it has been scenarios such
as these which have brought it into reality .
