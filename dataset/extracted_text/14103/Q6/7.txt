QUESTION : 06 Ans. 6 The specified comment in the Question might All oue lucaux this relates directly to the characteristics of a cloud computing model i.e. scalability and elasticity. cloud Computing has the major advantage of prouding salatulity - to accomodate the Growing demand of Resources over time without causing unavailability of resources . (S ) elistically, a complimentary charactuislic, is the automatic provisioning of minouzus as the demand fluctuate, especially during peak intervall whey the "number of uns accessing the cloud solice tycrean manifold times. As specified in Question, on pick days, the no wotomeus is crean to a great Extent, as Scanned with CamScanner was a unut the load oy the gunurus would increase and if preplanned this would result in hostage, co entially deefore cloud if the J company amumes a large infijas, then on geneal mot of days these resources would go wasted, A while on peak days ownload may happen failure could result So , this may have resulted in disculopment of Cloud Computing. On peak days, whey load 11 , the load Balancer could we applied to manage the in coming haffic and perform Autoscaling of Resources ley performing virtualization of creating no of VM's as pur demand on the peak time y accomodate the baltic. When the demand Il, the road will be reduced, alarm would provide notification to reduce the no R VM's and have Diffic will be Managed AWS CLOUD WATCH Autorcaling ALARM 1 if moof customer > x / 7 y VM ALARM? if no of customsin -- Z VM Q Scanned with CamScanner So , cloud computing could efficiently manage the suffic and is the cost will be reduced al the infrastructure is not wusted, Resources are put to use according to Requirement.
