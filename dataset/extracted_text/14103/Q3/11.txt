a ) To preserve the confidentiality
of
customer's credit card information
there
are
two
scenarios
that need
to
be
considered
according
to
the
question .
1) storage of credentials
-
since
the
customer might
want
to save the
card information
for
future
transactions,
it makes
muse
that
the
information
Cannot be
stored
OUD ouS/
It has
to
be
recured.
Thus strong everystion
techniques
( preferrably hardware " based )
need
to
be implemented
to
store
confidential data in encrypted
form .
2 )
Security of Data in Transit - Since this
payment module is ultimately
going to
forward the card data to bank site for
verification, and in a way data would
leave the computing perumeter and enter
enternal
network, it cannot be
sent
unencrypted" The SSL ( secure . Socket Layer)
Or & TLS ( Transport Layer Security ) protocols
need
to be put in place
to
ensure confidentakt
A
integrity
of data
- Hence
these
two
cases
and corresponding
protocols would
be
unplemented
b )
Since we are dealing with credit card
credentials, we would definitely have
to comply with PCI-DSS ( Payments card
Industry - Data Security Standard ) , to process
the card credentials.
The risk of data leakage would
breach
eupose credentials
of millions
of customers
leah and
has
the
potential to cause
damages worth
billions of dollars Hence,
it is mandatory to
" comply with all
PCI DSS standards
to mitigate rasks
of breach as well
as
to
limit
euposure
of data
in
cause
of one.
some
guidelines
are
1 .
Implementation of firewalls
2 .
Data is never stored unencrypted
3.
TLS / SSL

5.

6. Euternal

7. Auditing to provide complete Grausparency
