Ans3: (a) There are several of the customer's ways in which the confidentiality credit card can be preserved. Encryption -> The module must implement secure encryption mechanisms to while transferring sensitive information and even Boring in the database . This ensures privacy even if the data is compromised . (ii) Firewall The sections of the system dealing with card information must be protected a by a Strong corporate firewall. to protect it S against external attacks. ( iii ) Secure communication Protocol. - The module must use secure comm. protocols Such as SOL/TLS OY HTTPS . ( iv ) Proper authentication . 9 The module must implement a secure authentication process such as OTP Or dual factor authentication to allow only the card owner to access the information. A dual factor authentication protocol is the preferred choice for this application. The usey must give both CVV and a correct one Time Password (OTP ) to successfully make a transaction. This is because CVVs can potentially be stolen, but OTPs are alwayssent to the real customer and hence confidentiality is ensured. (b) The company needs to comply with the industry standard Payment Card Industry - Data security service OY PCI - DSS . This standard provides various requirements that a cloud service must follow to avoid compromise of payment info. These requirements, as listed in part ci) of the question, are: - O Encryption Secure Firewall 3 Secure Authentication y 4 ) Secure data communication Apart from these 4 requirements the standard also mentions other important requirements' , Restricted (or no) access to card information 2 Maintaining minimum logg of transactions. 3 Re-authentication of customer once in a while.
