3. a ) To preserve
confidentiality of customer's credit
information
which is essentially data at rest and
I will the data

fecansit
at
same phases of
tecomsaction .
Therefore, to preserve confidentiality of customer's
Credit cond information +" the best way is:
Encryption
of information at when data at rest
This
cryptographic technique is scrambelling to data to
make
it
1 useless
for any unauthorized
subject
to
use it .
. Integrity and authentication
at
each endpoint ensury
no
data modification and right ensures
that the
data moved
with
the right rxcopient .
Data - in - flight
if shared will need special
protocols
to be implemented over the transmission.
SSL / TLS
core
some
the such security protocols.
Jo comply
with the
process of credit card transaction,
the module should have & PCI- DSS Payment Card Interface
Data Security Hysteris ) stemdard.
This
is because the guideliness
and actions against vulnerability
01 , credentials
nightly
financial
listed
in PCI- DSS .
Therefore once ; this
standard
detained ,
the module can safely
work provided
the other end ( banking
in this case ) is
secure as well.
For security at Information
Technology Services ; such stemdards are a prerequisite. Some
other
important
standards
that can be applied here are:
Access Control (
IEC 27002 / ITIL )
Vulnerability Management

Patch Management ( IT2 )
st
is
observed that in credit card transactions security of
famection
is
inversely
proportional
to number
of steps / stages
of the transaction .
More the number of such Hagey more will be
the
chances
to of
on
unwelcomed
intrusion or data that
theft .
since ,
the
from is
impactful, such module shall
have a standard 9ff
PCI - DSS
which
has
the requirements and
guideliness
which
make
the
transactions
secure.
