corts of data breach and its associated repurcursions greatly outweighs the cost of private cloud . 7 Hence, given the scale of operations and the global scoper of presence a private cloud IS affordable and necessary 2) + The cloud service providers entend their servoices to their cust overs through application programming interfaces . -, Essentially , the services that the cloud service provider has to offer are physical hardware - computing resources, associated et work resources , platforms frameworks associated with computing, security and management features etc . - ) The APIS that the cloud service provider enlends are imbedded into Scanned with CamScanner application processes over the cloud . These application Processes would incur differences computing patterns over the cloud, which would consequently requiere for adjustment on the computing and storage resources ( scaling, load balancing ). These tasks can be managed on the go through APIs intended scalability - CSP provides API. that provide the capability of access management. The authentication, authorization and access control capabilities, that are standard features offered on cloud platform are entended as APIs so Lo that they can be embedded into applications that customer develops. - ) API D in cloud services thus eypose the various capabilities off the cloud platform providing a way four Scanned with CamScanner the customers to access those servicey, The API based services help in automating the various technical processes auto scaling , encryption, I AM) Scanned with CamScanner
