2) API Of Application Program Futerface provides
the option of a new service of an extension of
service to a Cloud Provider. A Cloud service Provider
can utilise an APP to provide a new service to
a customer os even use an APP to extend a
service APP basically defines how a service works
my giving it's syntone and nules.
A compromised APP can put the whole system
of organization in jeopardy. If a malicious use
comes aclose the API of a service; he can modifs
the APP to provide invalid services to the user of
evert deny services to a real . The wee will not know
the reason for such a problem.
Further, if an API is modified by an unknown
person , it can cause the virtual machine to
escafe from the Ventual machine Monitor and
access information on other virtual machines. This
will fout all vistual machine on threat of data
leakage .
An APP can also cause a byhelvisor to become

compromised. This will fuether fut all virtual
machines on a threat Any malicious user will be
able to use the hypervisor and access system reso
ueces and virtual machines.
Eg: -
If a company reveals their APP online , withow
any fraising of encryption, any malicious usee
can modify the API. This APP, when used by
the company, will but its Finformation and resour
res on threat and cause damage to the company.
An outside attacker will also be able to exploit
the vulnerabilities of the company.
Thus, it is whostant that an API is keht seu-
ely within a cloud.

credit card information , encryption and decryption
can be used . Whatever information is travelling over
the internet should be encrypted securely 80 that it
is not accessed by malicious users and the integr.
ity is also maintained.
