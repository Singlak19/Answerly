use of APLS
1 . APIS
allow the organizations esung services of CSP
to properly interface the code and API's OB Csp
based on the functionality.
They can integrate with CSP very easily without
worrying of the technology of miplementation & CSP.
2. They give an overall Idea of cloud architecture
and various services that CSP provides.
3 .
The end points. are very easy to test and help
to modularize the services provided by Csp ..

day, which time everything and if there is any
invousistence orstrange behavior then they can
debar a user from usurp services.
API's since they convey information about cloud ardutecture,
and infrastructure also pose a risk to the service as
attackers may fid vulnerabilities and try to enter the
system. Hence security of APls is very necessary ...
e.g .
