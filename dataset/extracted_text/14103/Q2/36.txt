X × Question 2 : APIs in CLOUD SERVICES. DEFINITION . ATJS or Application Programming Interface refers to the user upfront interfaces extended by the organizations so that the services offered by the particular apply of the organization could be used. Scanned with CamScanner API's in cloud services are very important because it is only through the APIs that the services are used from the Cop's side. USES The CSP would extend their APPS of the applications developed and these APIs could then be integrated with the services of the cloud users and their services could be used There is a shared infrastructure, hence all the chord "tenants' or users would be able to use these generalized / customized APIs by implementing them in their services. 5 PUBLISHING APIS & USES of APIS The API extended by the COPS help the users to understand the architecture and functioning of the sowices extended The expose the architectural details of the COP's Service and must Abe securely used. They also help the CSP to market and publicize their features- These API's could be extended and customized for special users by the csis . . API'S could be vulnerable security threats if the credentials are weak & moper authorization & authentication services are not used . Hence, we should also consider the security concerns related to vulnerability of details exposed by APIS. Scanned with CamScanner . Thus, APIs are very important to both the CSP & the users & their usage is irreplaceable Scanned with CamScanner
