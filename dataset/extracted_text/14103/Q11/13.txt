A-11 Availability Management is an important
hart of cloud service management.
For any cloud service boailability is aus
uwportant trait of evaluating it. NNow
for different Service models, responsibilities
of CSPand usersare different for maintainy
avallability. I'm case of Saas, Availability
Management is the sole responsibility of
CSPand user can only be held responsible
for authorization. Now customers need
in Saas
100% uptime. They are not concerned as to
whose responsibility it wwas to give areailali -
- lity. So they can monitor Service health.
They should monitor Saas health se
that they can qualitatively le evaluate
the service and see what are they gettys
out of it. they want their was health to
be 100% so that they can get more users
and they establish a positive eimage in the
market .
yes there are tools in market conel
can check Soas health Movilaring. they
dre used by customers to see the health
of their Saas service.

positive image ,
4. If they don't have good saas health, there is no use
of running this service.
