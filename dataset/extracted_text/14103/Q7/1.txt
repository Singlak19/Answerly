in full In full virtualization, the quest OS is unaware of the presence of virtualization and other guest OS 's over the same shysical machines. Ix basically emulators the functions of an actual device without virtualization which leads to latency essues. For ag. VM ware Moreover, in full virtualization the hypervisor has it's own processing requirements which further adds to latency issues. Those poroblems are solved in para- virtualization. In para virtualization, the guest OS is made aware of virtualization and presence of other os's. For g . you , This, in para virtualization, the tt hypervisor shots the drivers which directly interact with The barl hardware and modify The configuration of quest os to provide efficiency and reduces latency by avoiding emulation, For Although, There are some issues with paravirtualization as well. D. Many OS's do not allow para virtualization as it modes the configuration cof os The virtualization won't hold if on of the os's gets updated because in such a case configurations would change. Because of this reason in some Cases full hardware virtualisation is preferred.
