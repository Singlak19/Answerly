Aust: Para-virtualization generally outperforms Full virtualization.
Bout stixe full virtualization "has following advantages over
hora vintmalization: -
No Os modification required : In haravirtualization, questos needs
to be modified and underlying API structure need to to-spuate
with hypervisor drivers, while full virtualization donot require
any quel it mmodification.
* Easy migration !- In halavirtualization, questor drivers are closely
loupled with hypervisor drivers which makes migration difficult.
Migration become, almost impossivle if underlying architecture
changes. Migration is the love of Fault tolerance and maitaimenu.
and buch difficulties are not faild is full virtualization of
both quest Ds and hypervisor are way, coupled in it ...
S
Above two points state the advantage of fall virtualization over
halavirtualization .
