Q.7. Advantage of Full Hardwaw virtualization over pacavisualization . dus. i ) The major difference between palaritualization and full virtualization is that unlike full vierualization, in paca withalization the Os is aware that is being virtualized. ii ) To solve the problem of hypervisor needing large overhead in full intualization , the as deives and hypervisor dewess interact and coordinate with each other in pata mutualisation . iii ) Advantage of full hardware virtualization : 2) No Modification needed in DS being installed. since, para virtualization involves coordination between os divers and hypervisor devers, the guest os need to be modified before installation .. They need to be provided with appropriate drivers to be able to interact duectly with hypervisor . In fill virtualization, Os can be installed as its is on the physical machine . No modification is needed. ( 3) b ) Any update of os of hypervisor will not disrupt the system !! Ir paca virtualization, an update to os of hypeursor can cause beeakdomen of the durese. This is not so in full iltualization. Each os is independent of the other and any update to it does not affect its interaction with the hypervisor or its underlying physical resources.
