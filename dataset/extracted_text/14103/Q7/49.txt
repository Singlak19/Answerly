Ans 7: ( Assuming Full-hardware virtualization is Full - virtualization and not virtualization with Type- 1 hypervisor ) . In. Full hardware virtualization, the User can use standard operating systems such as windows and Ubuntu without any modifications . This helps in installing a variety of OSs without a problem . Whereas on a para-virtualized gystem, the core of the OS has to modified & recompiled for it to be aware of other VMS. This is a tedious task & therefore very few OSs are available for para-virtualized systems MEO This modification is often discouraged by big vendors like Microsoft & organisations often tend to use Os-level virtualization instead .
