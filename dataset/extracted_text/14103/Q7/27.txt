Ans 7 the advantage of full hardware visualization over para milualization is - full hardware level virtualisation emulates the undulying hardwrue just enough for the operating Syseis to sun urrodified in isolation In pala milialisation, the operating system needs to be modified slightly to reduce andthead. But this cannot work with will established companies like Microsoft who will not allour their Operating systems to be modified . this greatly reducen it Inumbut of OS's this can wolle with This is the advantage Of full hardware-level virtualization - Pasa milualization modifies the operating system of the ghost to reduce the evilation of hardware ! The host os and guest os can override some of the drivers that need to be emulated and the quest OSs know that the system is virtualized. h/w In full level virtualisation, the operating systems thun in complete isolation without knowing, the System is wiltcalised. this can wollk with all OSs since no Modification is required.
