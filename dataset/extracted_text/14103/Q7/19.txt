Ams7 . Advantage of full hardware virtualigett on over back vistualigation :
. No modification of Operating system !.
In para virtualization os need to be modilied to run on Rybavisos.
So most of vendors doesn't like this idea and their ase
small mumles of options
available .
So os choice is very limited in pace vistualisation.
Tight coupling of as and hypervisor :
OS and Rypervisors are Hightely
coupled in para virtuali-jodion
de to overlapping dirvers.
updates may creak
this coupling.
- Os changes may notbe compatible with Rypivious
- Heypourson change may not be compatible with us.
So special care is taben when debelating Os and hybribons.
Thees this leads to limited changes and improvements.
. Thus they may te promo to security vulnerabilities
due to
direct Interaction /10 Os and Ryeavis Do.
