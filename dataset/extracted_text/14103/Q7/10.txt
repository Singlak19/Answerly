QUESTION: 07 And . 7 Paravirtualization outpuforms full virtualization in performance as in paravirtualization the Gustos are modified to make them aware about the presence of a hypervisor, so instead of performy leinany Danslation, the Hype calls are und for communication A performance. full Virtualization Para Virtualization RING 3 USER APP RING 3 USER OAPPI RING2 MODIFIED RING 2 RINGI RING! GUESTOS BINARY I GUSTOS HYPER VISOR TRANCATON RINGO HYPER RINGO HYPERVISOR sys. HARDWARE SYSTEM HW The one major Advantage of full virtualization Duer pasa is that Gut Ds need not be modified at all. The quest os are completely unmodified, as they are unaware about the presence of Hylalibor & operate as if they would do in Ring - 0 of Kinil. .As a uncut, the Guest Os one un modified, so any operating system cay be used while in pand only open source Os could we und. vence, live are a large option for choice los. .
