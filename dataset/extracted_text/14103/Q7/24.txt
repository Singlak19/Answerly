7. Paravirtualisation generally outperforms full
hardware- level virtualisation.
An advantage of full hardware virtualisation
over paravirtualisation is :
There is no need of changing the configuration
of Operating System ( OS ) in fulll hardware
virtualization .
In full hardware virtualisation, the beating
Systems are fully isolated from each other.
while in case of para virtualisation, the
drivers of the hypervisor all integrated to
the OS drivers, elince ke PVdrivers Para Virtualization
drivers) are created.
Change in the configuration OS can
make it psone to attacks from malicious
entities, which is not the case with OS in
full hardware Vistualisation .
There is no overhead of changing the configuration
in full hardware virtualization .
