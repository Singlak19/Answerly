IF ) In
PARAVIRTUALISATION , APIS are provided such that the :-
(a) The OS is compiled in such a way that it includes
these APIA with its existing APTs
(s ) The DS is modified to call the API .
- In pasa mutualisation the guest os is modified io so that
it reduces the overhead cost of communicating with the hypeweson
and hardware ie the guest os is made aware that bet is
being untualised in an environment .
- I'M FULL VIRTUALISATION, the guest os is not aware that it is
being mutualised It operates without being aware of the ollen
VMs on the physical server.
- but the benefit of pasa-vutualisation ,is that : -
19 ) lince this requises modification of guest OS, not many
service providers ( like micosoft ) support such mutualisation
and operating system .
fience it reduces the choice of is available for such mitualisation
Is) Surce due to modification the guest DS is tightly coupled with the
hypenvior any updation in the os will break this coupling
Hence security updates & palches donot get installed on the
modified . os .
IC ) Que to the direct interaction of guest os & and hypervisor it
leads to major security concerns for the mutual machines
Id ) There is no t-low level emulation, the drivers of hypervisor
and Os Miteract with themselves
Whereas in full-hardware mutualisation there is no issue of
modified OS and hence no coupling with the hypemeson .
This is why full hardware mutualisation has advantage over
hava- vutaliation
