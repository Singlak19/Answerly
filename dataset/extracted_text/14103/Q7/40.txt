Answer-7), Though paravirtualization is better than Full hardware level virtualization in almost all fronts like cost effective, energy efficient, & feet etc, there is one & area where paravirtualizations lacks behind full virtualization. That area is - In paravirtualization, the guest OS is aware that it is being virtualiget. That is i'm this type of virtualization, quest OS needs to be modified . This is because quest OS drivers has special drivers which teck thout circuit the normal route fou of instructions from hardware to hypervisor. to questos. In other words , quest OS & hypervisor coordinate with each other to make the solution fastle & cost-effective. Bust in for full virtualization this is not the case as hypervisor emulates all of the resources & quest is the issues normal handmake instructions. Hence, the issue with paravirtualization is that it requires quest OS modification. This leads to problems like Every guest os needs to be modified based on to the hypervisor. This makes it difficult to scale. There &'This leads to strong coupling between quest OS x hypervisor. tience, it beads limits the available combinations. 3 of any one of quest OS DE hypervisor needs can to be updated, it leads to compatibility issues
