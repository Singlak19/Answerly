And 7- )
( i ) Parovirtualization
short circuits low
level tasks like
direct access of
host os drivers, so that guest os
doesn't
first interact with VMMs drivers
followed by host os drivers.
[ 11 ) for this short circuit special API need to
imbedded in quest os,
so that direct and
correct
"driver interaction '
is possible .
Criif this definitely raises performance when
compared to
full hardware - Level virtualization,
but
demonds tweaks in quest os.
Civy
The changes required in
guest os may not
Microsofts'
be always
possible, as windows of may
object to that.
( v.) Also, on update in hypeversor / NMM software
would render the paravirtualyed quest os
useless as its interfacing could potentially
be disturbed.
Avil This
full hardware virtualization is
face from these concern, updates wouldn't matter,
quest os need not be changed.
