Full hardware virtualization
though has been outperformed by
para virtualization to " but there is still one advantage
that is given by full hardware virtualization . over para-virtuali
zation
and that is
the
indempendency of
the VM's ( virtual Machines )
the hardware.
For if required
to change or relocate the
hardware ,
in
full
virtualization
its
VM
easy and
or
hove 9
more
convenient - to
shift
virtual
machines over one
pool
resources
to
the other .
This
is
not similiarly
possible
in
paravirtualization
where
VM'S
still
requires
a
significant number with configuration details for migration.
