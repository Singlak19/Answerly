full hardware - level virtualization is where the guest oberating systems are not modified and are not aware are present of virtualised systems . that they Hypervisor handles all the virtualisation requirements. Different machine level instructions all sent to different Os . Pala - virtualisation is where the quest as is modified to make it compatible for the virtualisation with the hybervisor . In This 1 the guest of are fully aware their virtualiation . 08 Due to the extra processing done any hypervisor in full - hardware level virtualisation , the selver performance gets down para - virtualisation ourbeforms it . But there are some advantages associated with full- hardware level virtualis ation as well :- AS the full virtualisation, does not depend on the modification guest os, it can attract a large num bee of os vendors available as many os vendors like microsoft have problems in modifying theirv Os which para - virtualisation demands . so , with the inyeared choices, the variety of os working in virtualisation increases. Moreover in full virtualisation , the as does not become dependent on hypervisor for all its actions . as is done in para virtualisation . The Os is free of such complicated restrictions + can beaform well. In para virtualisation - O " needs to be compatible with the VMM to access the Resources and short circuit their drivers to get This done full virtualisation does wot let the os to indulge in such things.
