Question 7:
Para virtualization /s full hardware- level virtualization
FULL VIRTUALIZATION Involves the simulation of hardware such that
the I'Ms are isolated and Grust Ds are rimmodified.
. It requires a lot of tasks to be performed by the UMM Hypervisor.
" including communication with phy resources, GOS and also controlling
all the resource allocation tasks .
Eg VMWare .
PARA VIRTUALIZATION inoshees short circuiting of the OS & UMM drivers
such that the communication becomes direct & the 90s is modified &
it knows that it has been virtualized.
Eg Xen
. Paravirtualization outperform the full virtualization bicause
in full virtualization , the hypervisor has special computation &
resource needs which overalls affects the performance of the system
as resounces have to be allocated for hypuvisor.
But paravirtualization involves close dependency and light coughing
of the OS and the hypervisor which poses security vulnerability
and compatibility issues.
ADVANTAGE Of FULL VIRT.
The GOS ( just Operating System) is unmodified in full but
it has to be modified in para virtualization .
The modified Gos appears unappealing to the vendors & also poses
problems like
- Version compatibility elw Os & UMM
- security vulnerability
- tight coupling t/w gs & 6MM.
