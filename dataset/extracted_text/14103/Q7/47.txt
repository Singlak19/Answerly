Os Q7. In Para- Virtualization, the knows that it is being Virtualized. with this knowledge, shecial drivers can be installed on woth the IS and hypervisor that het in direct communication with the of hardware. This reduces the overhead of the higher-viser. and the VM may herform slightly letter. The special a drwers are generally a hart of the OS eg xen . This approach has a disadvantage Due to the tight coupling leow the OS and the hyperVisor, if any updates are made to either. the entire service may belak. Also making changes to the OS are generally not favoured by vendors Applications OS Pvdaever Pu Dauer hyper visor Physical hardware In Full Virtualization, the OS doesn't know that it is being virtualized. Emulation of the os takes hlace inside the hypervisor . The hyperVisor provides an & environment cau completely identical to the a native machine, it does instruction translain on the fly and only has a minor performance reduction at best. g Vmware, Vortual Bon. An advantage Full Virtualization has over para Virtualization is that more number of os Vender support it. dinese in one UM, windows in another Um. The two Ums are completly seharated from each other ( UM isolation) mo knowledge about each other.
