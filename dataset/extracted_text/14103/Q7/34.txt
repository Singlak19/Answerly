F ) Full viutualisation is when there are multiple VMS
On one handwave but they are are unaway of the
presence Otherr Vs. This can be done
Win when VMS ale on diffcient Operating Systems.
The hypowisou kups allotting the resources based on the
requirements of the different viutual machines.
The hoppleviseu also needs space file and resource
in full hardware viutualisation which makes it a
little slow .
Some enamples are. VMWare etc.
In para - virtualisation all the virtual machines are
awave of the other viutual machines. The hi
Viutual machines alle hence fully depchwent on the
hypevisons and hence this can lead to puiracy issues .
Though full viutualisation is slow But there are no
security themars because the VMS are completely unaware
that it is being virtualisea .
Moreover Paraviutualisation uses modifica APIS lince
they are not very accelstable fou companies like Microsof etc.
One sample of Paravirtualisation is Xen
