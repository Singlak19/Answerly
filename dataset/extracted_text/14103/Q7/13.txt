Ans ] one advantage
full virtudization over
pora- virtudization
is
that : - full di
full virtudization
creates
loose coupling
between the hypervisors the quest os ..
wheres
it para-virtualization their is tight
coupling
blu hypervisor
a quest os.
This is
so becouse
in
full virtualization
Guest OS is not
of all modified , i all
the drivers are installed, in the hypervisor
it self .
Therefore upgrading the version of
hypervisor
does
not
lead
to any
kind of
compatibility issue
blu guest os a hypervisor.
of hence
upgradation
can easily be done.

But in
pora-vistadication to reduce
the computation
burden of the
hyperdoisor, some
of the drivers
are installed in
hypervisor A some ore installed
in guest OS.
Hence
updating The hypervisor
might lead
compatibility issue with the

working.
This created
