7 In full virtualization, the devices are emulated These devices include network adapters, RAM memory, DMA etc . The problem with device emulation is that it introduces time overhead surce emulated operations ore Dow, Thus the performance is affected. eater -) in order to reduce these overheach , , the performance concept of para - virtualization was emplared. The funda mental difference blow the two types is that in full votialyation , the OS is unaware about the esistence of Hyper visor 50 wat is not the -cat in case of para virtualijalon In para-ourtualyation , the OS is modified to acknowledge the eviolence of Hypervisor and the path blus device OS is short - cureuited. Ft no longer has to go through an emulated channel . Haveng said that, hypervisor still manages the access to the devices, multiplewing the devices Hur different UMS A since access is direct performance is vark by unproved in case of para. Full - Hardware has advantages - No need to modify OS. The IS needs to 18 modified in case of para - verlualization This modification introduces proftems- 1 ) since UM S talking to hypervisor, it can lead to security compromises through cuecution of malicious instructions affecting other VM 2 ) It introduces cohesion blur Hypervisor siuve "code have been altered to Match requirements of Hypervisor. Hence parking VerssiONS of WS would became troublesome,
