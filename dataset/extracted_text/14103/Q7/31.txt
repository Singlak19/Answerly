Quest full virtualization means the virtual machine is directly
in contact with the hypewiser which is in contact with
the system hardwareand os.
full vistualization is rends to give full access to the
host UMs with the hypervisor because each VM has
different needs of hardware and different computation
Speeds. Hence, the host VM donot have to wait for
some resource when the process it is performing is
important and cannot afford an interupt.
Hence, this is advantage of full virtualization. This is
because :
1) when it comes to para virtualization, the VMs know
that they are being vistualized and they can share
or adjust resources accordingly. But, when a UM has
been performing an important process where it can
change the registers or something and if the UM
require hardware which is currently been used by
some other VM, an interrupt can occur in the former
UM and it can even damage the system.
2 ) In full virtualization, the host VMS are 'solated from
each other such that the functioning of one VM is not
visible to other and data is not exchanged within
those VMs.
3 ) full access and direct contact with hypervisor
ques better output and better functioning of other
VMs.
4) VM Ware is a workstation which supports full vistualiz-
ation and Mence, it can use the disk space, resources
of the hypewifor easily and can pelfown the process
with great speed and more efficiently.
