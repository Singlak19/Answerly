Fig: para virtualization
In para virtualization, operating system is aware of virtualization
and it is modified to interact with hypervisor aciddinghy.
It short circuits its device drivers and uses device drivers o)
Mypoursor to execute the mistructions . In this way
para virtualized system avoids 'silent death of previuged
instructuctious ' that may happen in full virtualization and
also is fast .

In Full hardweave virtualization , physical hardware is
sufficiently emulated by the hypervisor that unmodified
operating system can le run on that hypervisor. This is
the advantage of using full virtualization that operating system
need not be modified in case of full virtualization.
