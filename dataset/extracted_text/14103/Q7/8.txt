AF Paramutualization genually outperforms full hardware - level virtualization . In Para - virtuali - zation the quest OS is made aware of leving virtuels of the which helps to short its aruuits and directly communicate with hardware rather than have to go through hypervisor, So the time for instruction comversion is saved. One advantage of full hardware virtualyation over Paravirtualization is that It doesnot require modification ft braust os. FuEll hardware-level virtualization is where As hypervisor is installed on Rastos and the not amere guest OS is of leving virtuelized and it interacts | use the hardwire resources through hypervisor. Instructions are converted on the fly ley the hypervisor. Hypervisor weeks in interacting of the guest os with the hardware. whereas in Para virtualization the quest OS is made aware that it is leving virtualized ley modification introduum a little modification . Ist This is Done advantage because laay comfames like Microsoft, do not want to change their windows. 8 ruefoost para - virtualization - crunt lowest rust OS as Ds maily molly Os Os modification regd.
