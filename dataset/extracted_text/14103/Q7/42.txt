This is what exactly a cloud computing serie provides autoscaling with Load Balancing In this ,. the ho . Ah shivers set up according to the requirement and balance the load among themselves. As soon as, the thal increases. as will be in the case of such Special Days, the no. of sevens increase up to Da level whose they can balance the load with overloading. Auch I automatic scaling helps the website to stay up and some the leye amount of customers. 7. Para virtualization where the guest OS butres that it is being virtualised and syncs its derwes with the drivers of the hyborvisor out performs full virtualisation as it stops accessing The resources in idle state and havel the utsources ant used efficiently while this is not the case with full virtualisation . Though paravirtualisation outperforms full virtualisation, full virtualisation has advanty Over paramrituelisation one of which is- Isolation . In case of full virtualisation, At guest Os is completely oblivious of the ernstence of another hypervisor or other guest os while in case of para virtualization the gust OS Syncs of its divers with the drivers of the hypowiser. Isolation is a bright because in case of attack over one guest os, in case of para virtualisation " the citlacher can get control of the hypervier and hence, other youst os while this is difficult in case of full virtualisation. Also in DV, The QS quest os needs to be modified and sont made compatible with the hybrison which is not required in case of full virtualisation
