7 ) Paravirtualization outperforms full hardware- level of virtualization because it uses modified quest os with proper parawiritualization drivers to access I/ 0 resources. west Os coun simply bypass via these deview. and hence acus is faster than that of fulls witvalkator. But it also has a disadvantage as the the quest Os has to modified which canot 5 ho done with closed souwice OS such as windows. Moe os etc . Also this modification increases cost. fand increases vulnerabilities in the quest OS. Such vulnerabilities becomes major security issues Whereas in full withalization the complete instruction is emulated which results in zero modification over quest OS- Full vertualization suuppoint all types of OSes whereas para virtualizationn supports only limited number of operating systems.
