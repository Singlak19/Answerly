Ans 7) Prisvirtualization generally outberssoms full hardware.
level virtualisation as it csuses efficient utilisation
of ressurces and reduces work load.
However, one advantage of full hardware
virtualisation ( FHV) over Paravirtualisation (PV) is
that i'm F HV all UMs are icompletely isolated
and linsuse of each other . This protects pressible
access from one VM to another. Alss, there
is not a tight dependence between hypervisor and the VMs.

Im baisvirtualisation, UMs are
avoire that
they are u virtuslised and it is possible to
sim access from one UM to another.
Alss there is a tight dependence between hypervisse
and VMs such that updating of one am cause
another its fail .
