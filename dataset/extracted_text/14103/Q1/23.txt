Ans. 1 a ) (i) VM Elasticity : The amount of data to be recieved at the cloud service is and can be calculated. The Elasticity feature can Make sure, that only / required starge devices and running and the not required / devices are not in use . Hence it will Save Energy and cost . Therefore VM Elasticity is important in Alis case . STAED Mence No surprise or unusual traffic will be there. Hence a simple auto- scaling feature will make sure of the cloud service's availability. . . VM Elasticity is not important in this case. ( ii ) Upfront cost : Upfront cost will be there as the KI has to set up computing devices at the intersections ( Major computation is not performed at the cloud) .. No. Upfront Cost benefit Cannot be availed fully . ( Not important ) (iii) Reduced Maintenance . . Since the computing devicers ( sysleves for accident I near miss will be at the intersections ( out of cloud) . . . Maintenance has to be provided by the KI Hence Reduced Mainkane feature of cloud Campung will not be much benefitial. o KI is capturing data of 75% of the world's biggest cities intersections and his data has a lot of value as well as privacy Concern. If the data is leaked / or is in hands of an attacher then it can provide behavioral , 10 temporal and personal activities & patterns . . puting the data on pullic cloud will not be a safe idea Nance the data must be kept on a Private cloud
