. d.
io UM Elasticity is an important feature for KF, because
elasticity allows the cloud to be infinitely scalable.
- KIS Computing needs will constantly keep growing in
She withich is wery flexibility" by a characteristic like
elasticity will allow them to always be able to accomodate
for changing needs.
IT. KI is a local startup with limited amounts of funds
trying make the best "what they have.
-No upfront cost& will allow them to save on cash, which
they could preferably ye elsewhere.
I Not only will KI's computing needs for resourcey be wetg they
bull also gaul up on a chunk ofliquid capital thanks to
obthis feature.
Ill. Maintenance costs can pile up & turn out be quite substantially
expensive.
- VI being a local startuf can benefit from not having to
worryabout maintenance , as they can focus on their primer,
they're trying to solve.
b . A Private Houd has the possibility of being more secetce of the
cloud environment is no longer millienancy , ie, not bein.
shared by others,
- However, siablotesei KI should not build their fun
private cloud.
* Charging needs - KIAas only grown to 75. fuworld yling cities,
There is still a need for scaling higher up to meet the possibility
of growing more.
I A privately build cloud will be extremely expensive to build,
moreover, man tendance costs will suck the life out of fire,
wombamy.
") They should stick to secure public cloud services like Amazon
IWeb Services that are trusted & secure,
- ra Moreover, the dafe they send to cloudy isn " t
extremely sensitive , since "
Io Denaturing of video before storing
2. Only processed , relevant bets are sent to closed,
) So the trade off between security & elasticity / sheakenog bud
towards the latte ..
* NO , they shouldn't build their own private cloud.
They should focus on investing where it matters I puffing their
efforts & time into solving the bigger problem they fought
out .
-- Building a Private cloud will only bose hondrance to
that bigger purpose.
