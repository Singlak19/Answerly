i) VM Elasticity. VM elasticity helps the user to access the cloud service from anywhere around the world which has internet commectivity and also to entend the no of VM's on the same cloud . This feature is highly beneficial to KI because it helps them record or capture data from different locations process it using VM at the intersections and send to the cloud. 1" ) No wwffront Cost. This means that the company Ikl doesn't need to buy the infrastruchin Ar other softwares beforehand and they can kent the resources they want to use on pay as you go basis . Thus this feature is also of high importance to Klas it btsaves them from druge amount of initial investments. iii ) Reduced Maintenance. This feature helf's the company focus on the critical port and on their business rather dhom worrying about the server or UM maintenance. This feature us this also high iimportance to they will be able to dedicate all their resources towards the actual process and not maintenance. There is n me need for KI de go to private cloud as the maith benefit of private cloud no more security and privacy & but kl is already ensuring privacy for all the drivers, Gyclists pedestrians etc . by denaturing the video at the intersection itself before it is stoed. Thus there is no highly private vinformation that is stored on the cloud. Also building a private cloud would inceur ruge costs for KI was the scale is very large and the retiram on such an investment is mot worth it as toke no the's privacy is at risk. So they should bep working on ple public or hybrid cloud (if there is any business critical information) and treas benefits of lower case without al shifting to private cloud.
