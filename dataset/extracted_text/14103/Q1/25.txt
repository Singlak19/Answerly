CLOUD
COMPUTING
a )
(i)
VM Elasticity
VM Elasticity
is
basically
provisioning + de-provisioning of
cloud
resources
to
the
cloud
users depending on
their
current
needs .
As
the
Kayvon
Inc.
has
a
Limited
bandwidth from intersection
point
to
cloud ,
the
chances
of
sudden
increase in
the
need
yeso voices
are
very less . The amount of
data
supplied
through
this
network
to the cloud
will
be
nearly
same .
So
there
js
not much need
provisioning
+
deprovisioning
rejources at
Go
of
a
greates
level .
So
the
elasticity feature of
cloud
will
not
be
of
much use to KI in
this
scenario
And the
main
gleason
behind this is
limited
bandwidth
of
network .

No
upfront
cost
CI
do
gels
a
benefit from this feature of cloud
as
they
need not to
manage
of
create
their own
cloud
and
can
pay
for as much
desources
08
the cloud
as
they are
using . As the
network
bandwidth
is
limited ,
KI
may
require
vely less resources
of
the
cloud
and
so
they need not to create all
the
infrastructure
of
other responsibilities associated with
the cloud .
They
can
do
that
investment
in
processing
data
at
intersection .
(iii)
Reduced
maintenance
The data
stored
by KI
on the cloud
needs to be
maintained
property
and that
maintenance
includes keeping
its confidentiality ,
De culity
of
authenticity up to mark
and in this case ,
all this
maintenance is done by
3 rd
party
service
provider
so
the importance of
this
feature
lays
down
for the company . Although,
the company's
most
04
the data is getting
processed
maintained
on
the intersection only , which
reduces
its
importance
to
some
extent
but
even
then
-
the
sucial
data is
maintained in
cloud
only.
b )
If
KJ
has
grown
and
gone
such big ,
then
yes ,
CI
should
go for a private cloud.
Private
cloud
provid es
you
the following benefits :-
flexibility ;- As the
private cloud owned
by a company
shared with anyone else , the company can
is
not
"it
according ly
at
any point of time
Customize
according
to
their
need .
Seulity : Private
cloud
provides
more seclle envimommen
to
the
data
as
the
same
sesomces
all
not
shared
among
different
organisations.
so
the
leakage
information or breach
of
any kind of
sensitive
to confidentiality
to
the
personal data is not
possible .

AS
different
countries
follows
different quidlines
rules
for
storing
+
processing data , private dond
allows
you
to
make
it
flexible
according to the
situation .
So , in this
case as
well ,
the
KI
should
90 for
a private
cloud
to
Ikeep
the
functioning

of
data
In
more
smoother
