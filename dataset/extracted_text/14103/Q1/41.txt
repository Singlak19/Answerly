1 ) a ) ; ) UM Elasticity
In case Kayvon Inc. wants to setupinstall thees
setup only for one city then the data traffic
is constant.
since its there are n intersections
then
no . of
cameras
will also be constant and
hence
dato
will also be constant. Therefore
elasticity
in
this
case will not matter much .
But
the
stattup grows, and staits to install
their
setup to other cities as will then I elasticity
will
matter . The resources will increase with
increase in traffic ( data ).
Another
thing is that
they are not sending the
whole
stream just
the interesting parts . Now in case
there
is
large
road traffic
then the date
sent
will
large and hence
requirements
tree for
servers
increase so
elasticity mattery in
this case.
ii ) No / upfront Cost :-
Upfront cost in the initial
cost invested in computing
resources, to Sivere, standup is going to install their setup
the limited busy intersections, therefore this
hardware
requirements arre clear and hance they
can
either opt for their own perivate cloud
is Maintenance cost will also be clear. But
If the maintenance cost matters then they can opt
for
third party cloud somica provider . In bath
causes
the
upfriont cost will be different. cloud
by
Third party will be cheaper than cloud on
its
own premises .. ( pay per use )
is ) Reduced maintenance: - Maintenance will matter. As
the company adapt's for cloud on it's own peremles
then
the
maintenance will be high . But if company
adopts
for private cloud by third party they
maintenance
cost well be reduced. So The maintenance
cost matters to the company.
b ) 24
KI
wants to
cover
75%
of
The would's big
cities, then it will
have
to
face many legal
issues
beused
on
the
country
Some countries may
wat allow
data
to "
gent
outside their country.
build
This will require them to
alost their own prinale
cloud. This land
shoud be distributed as each
city may have their own cloud data center. This
will
increase cost of
murvenance significantly.
In case There are no legal issues then they can
either build their own pernate loud at a single
data center
or they can adept a private cloud from
third party.
Adopting the perinate cloud from third
10
party
will
significantly reduce their maintenance
cast
as they also have to maintain cameras
and
their setup, So they should not fuild thing
crown
pernate cloud in this case.
