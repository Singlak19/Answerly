Ans 1 : ( a ) VM Elasticity VM elasticity can be important for KI in case the number of incidents increase on any particular day . The flexibility of adding more VMs on bay-as-you-go can be very efficient for KI (ii) No upfront cost. => Yes, this cloud computing benefit is important for KI. The data in question involves inputs from Various intersections of an entive city. If the infrastructure was not provided ready-made by the CSP, the startup has to manually set up the complete infrastructure and incur huge investments, which are not easily available to startups . KI saves large amount of time & money . (iii ) Reduced Maintenance : - The maintenance time and cost of Kayvon Inc. will definitely be less. This helps them invest move towards the computing logic and applications for the given task. Hence this benefit of cloud computing is also important for K I . ( b ) Migrating to a private cloud can provide several advantages to the business of KI . The primary advantage is the improved privacy of the drivers , cyclists and pedestrians . Also , the source code of their application can be secured # from external attackers suchas business competitors. On the other hand, setting up a private cloud requires huge investments and operational costs . Also , since KI is already denaturing the video , the privacy of the subjects may already be secured . Werver, Migrating to cloud may als e provide lower dependency on external CSPs Hearce Overall, migrating to cloud is a good aption for KI since it will provide several advantages & risk reduction options . at
