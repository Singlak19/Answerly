1. a) Iis VM elasticity : UM elasticity won't be an important factor
for KI brause they are processing similar kind of data in
similar environment. Also, they are now storing on intersting
cases, so less migrations and transmitions will happen.
nence, UM elasticity won't be of any use.

" "is No upfront cost : As mentioned in the context, the application
deplayed by Kayvon Inc. needs to be up and active for all the
time without any disruption. So it becomes an important factor
Iw for them that there is no upfront cost. They can be charged
only if there is any wage of the computing resources
it's Reduced maintainence : The application deployed by Kayvon Inc.
is quite heavy duty and extensive in nature. They needs
availability and accessability of the computing resources 2417

to a suduced maintainence will be a boost for them. They
can rely on a segment of system in their architecture that
will be efficiently maintained and is easily accessible
b) Yes, KI should have their own private cloud considering
in mind that the extent and quantity of data they are
prowzing need to remain confidential and secured that can
4)
only be achieved through a private cloud setup.
Every country has its own suiles and regulations to
collectedd
process the data of it's citizens. The data from various
countries across globe cannot stay together on a public cloud.
Although There will be scalability issues, but in that case
also they can easily shift to hybrid cloud setup.
Also building a private cloud and not a public will
provide for Data assurance ce. the type of data collected by
KI is not used for other purposes ce. election inclinations,
polling, advertisements etc.
