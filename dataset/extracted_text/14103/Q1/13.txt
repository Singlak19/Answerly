we Row that due to limited bandwidth KI has decided re process stream of Data of the intersection to identify near misses A accidents. If they will send the dou for the "interesting or desired coles " to cloud for storage + potential luxthese analysis . UM elasticity - refers to process of creding large number of images of UM's ( GAMI's ) when heavy parallel computing & processing is keeppired But in our case only results of some desired coses are only being send to cloud storage that too can be analysed further. on is there 28 burden of immediate pordled processing . .. un eldticity is not going to be of any importance Ci) No upfront cost - Since only desired results are being send to cloud it are unther. anodysed . ... KI will only pary The amount of resource it is uses They can be both storage of computational Cost . KI does Love to make any large initial investment to buy Storage A computationd resources of it's oun . . .. No iffront cost is advantage of cloud computing which is of importance the KI. Ciïin Reduced mointenance- Since KI does not have to own it's resource for storage i& computationd analysis is it is using cloud provider resources for this purpose. ... It has reduce KI cat mointoinance of Storage resource A andytical tools/ 6 Hence it is of importance to KI. b ) A company should prefer private cloud only if has to store & process some highly confidentin Data. Mese KI is not storing any confidenti'd Doha , it is fast storing it for some analysis purpose. . . . Going for private cloud in not good option instead they should continue to use the public cloud model . y Also, since it is targeting to cover 75r. of big cities , setting up private cloud to accomodate such large amount of aser bose is data would be very costly ) would demand high maintornaRe Public should be prefered over private cloud
