21 a ) 1 ) UM elasticity - Yes, Un elastitaly is an important factor for any and every organization that is hManning on making its service availabilitylobal. This ( elasticity ) allows the organization to increase and decrease the amount of allocated resoures at a moments notice. Since the company plans on whloading the Hideo data to the cloud, and since the naturt of suze of video files is usually large even when onlyus interesling Cases are uhloaded, the commo organization may run out of storage eventually . Thus elasticity allows it to provision more storage 2) No uffrent lost- since the company is a startun It may not have that much cash with itself hay for the sources. cloud computing allows users only to hay for what they consume. Thus this is an unportant factor / benefit for the Company . 3 ) reduced maintenance cost - Ste Since the infra Stauchwie is being rented when cloud computing is living employed, this reduces the overall costfor the Organization, and the cloud service provider is now tasked with maintaining the hardware. The reduced lost will be beneficial for the start uh .. a ) Parwate Cloudis usually used by medium to large organizations, government agencies, financial Institutions, since the documents that they store are usually sensitive. # Pauwate Cloud adds a layer of security to the forin since the data storage is decicaled solely to that organization. This allows for greater control over the environment and can be customused to the Organization 3 needs. In Case of KI, the data that they store and wake is usually made available to the pulilic. The data that they store is high Volume low security data . This ofting for private cloud would significantly increase their cost of since a sigurficant amount of money.se will be required to maintain the hardware. These it is not adviced to build perwate cloud. Instead "KI should sht for hyloved Cloud (" not already using) since its comlunes the benefits of booth howate and hulilic Cloud.
