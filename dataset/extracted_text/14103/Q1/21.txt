( 1) VM Elasticity : UM Elasticity is definitely be
impostant benefit for dayvon Inc ., because,
at some point of
time there may be
no
interesting cases
for which Server utiling ation
of cloud would
be very less and
at
Some pointe of time " interresting cases"
needed
to
be reported could be high so
Seuveer
utilization vories, so you UM elasticity
would
definitely be important as they will
help elong to we Seewey as much sequired,
( ii )
No upfront cost : - This benefit
offered
by cloud with
also be inpoutant
as the data which is captured by the
from using
"Video Streaming will be uploaded
on the cloud. So
they would
be no
upfront cast .

( iii ) Reduced Maintenance o- As the data is
being stored in the cloud, so dayvon
Inc.
would
not
worry about infrastructu
-se, hardware and mechanisms required
to
Star and puncess data. Move over they
need not worry about
maintainance and
fault tolerance
and
laad
balancing at
the hardware level
because infrastructures
and haved wan is provided by cloud. So
three maintainance is no pain to finns .

Of KI has grown and gone Internalloud

they
could build their own private

They should consider building a
