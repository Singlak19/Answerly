1. Geab tate = 20fl.
a ) i) VM Elasticity :
- The number of cameras deployed ake fixed
- The grab tate is fixed
- Monitoring 24 howes
" If we consider traffic on a weekday.
there will be higher chances of accidents
dweing woth & school going hours, so say
8 .7 am - 10 am
21 pm - 3 pm
4pm - 7 pm
At Heese lia
And on the weekends it may vary according
to destinations eg Malls, Recreational
enke routes may face higher chances
of accidents & near misses.
Hence the need for elasticity arises at the
number of resources Required in identity
and storing data which be higher at
certain time or day.
27) No upfront cast : Apart from cost of cameras
and other physical equipments, The
could storage and analysis facilities
will be available at pay as you go
bicing depending on the resources and their
use. It is important as a conaberDy it would
be ffe difficult for a company to pay
ok so many Resources like data centers,
Mecrees, analysis, backup etc. upfront.
ii ) cloud computing provides the facility of
Reduced maintenance which is helpful
to Kay von as it saves up on resources
& o man Bouwer which would otherwise
have to be invested into maintaince.
In a situation where physical servers
are on on bremise it is a hassle to
take care of their maintainence&
a huge cost to the company.
It providence load balancing, failonce
and Resource consolidation.
b ) KI has grown hence it's critical data and
Storage requirements mustre grown too.
But it can merely use a already existing
private cloud service with pay as you go
peteling without spending it's eegources on
building a new cloud with the samefeatures
as already existing ..
They can make use of off the Shelf technology"
and make as much useof it as possible.
Instead it should invest in implementing
better security and Privacy protocols on it's
already existant infrastructure.
2) Bottle backup and incident response
3) How to prevent outages & downtime
(4) Expanding its business to the rest of the
world.
