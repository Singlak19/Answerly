") ;jVM Elasticity: It is important to
Kavyou Inc because suppose on one day
" intersecting" cases are less, then they willneed
less power to compute andofurther analyse.
but if no of accidents increase, i. e. intersecting
Cases are more, then more no of virtual matiins
might be needed for more processing of stream
Idemlors
and further anorlysig so elasticity will to vistas', my of
UM based uponneed.
jil No up front cost : Cost is essential part for any
organisation and "yes" in this case, uhfrent cost
wil reduce which is the benefit of cloud computing.
It is pay as you go serove which will vary to
utilisation of UM'S according to the Stream
data
1) Reduced Maintenance : This point is debatable
as cloud computing requires lot of services to set
up, lot of severs, storage but it also
provides , various looks like nagios cloud
watch to monitor UM. In fact destroying um is for
easier than deleting the whole server. So cloud computing
con helf is reduced maintainenence and should be implemented.
1 ) Here we will look on two important aspects which
KI will be needed.
1) High browsing power.
2 ) Privacy of data.
So, a hylerid cloud voil be a better option as
It provides flexibility to KI to kelf some part as
private cloud and other as public data.
Now, the data like face of pedestrians, cyclists etc are
highly confidential and if leaked, might lead to
Haygus tragedies. So for these faces and other
denofidentiyal things, they should use private cloud.
Now, As it's written "75% of world's big cative,"
so they will be needing high processing power and lot
of maintainst. so it can be provided with to the
help of public cloud . Therefore only private cloud
might not be suffwent and we may need hybrid cloud.
