Cloud computing will provide various Benefits
to kayvonline as ;
i) Multitenancy : usage by multiple users
Bernd it administrators, developers
of the company , analysts who
will anallegge the situation and
then cau fredt the Bossiple mier and
regulations to miplement to minimuse
hid accidents .
iii) large storage : Ao large amount of data is to stored
based ou types of data ( video fames or
database of records ) from various
intersection points
i ) Accessability ; compared to traditional approach,
and Availability
Nod
will be more accessible
iv ) scalability

of Elasticity
vi) pay as you go
vordering other opportunities like
i) VM Elasticity : is trocess of ine and dee. the
## monge of
virtual machines / monters of
quest OS on hastes depending on the demand ,
As VM trovides foods feovides opportunity
to MIM quest Oses on hast Oses. So with
the help of this , company can run various
softwares on somme host os. Elasticity of VMS.
will help to in various type of softwares
depending on the need and Remailed! As.
1) diff Uses for diff intersection points
and when there is some frind of construction
or less traffic or less misses & arcidelits,
then collaborations could be done.
rwhen there is more , then diff softwares
for different purposes could Be in Von
questoos .
ii) diff . quest Os based upon functionalitie
boot no records of near irsses or
accidents .
VM finstrenty will help the company but it
will surely ime the security & prindry
threats. Therefore, company need to
take achow accordingly and Varse prolocols
according
dingly ,
As bandwidth fforth intersection to Cloud is limited
80
VM Elastiilay willensure proper processing of stre datos .
a) No upfront rost ,
upfront rost will does not provide
much Benefit to the instormers no Lehe
main focus should be on the functionality
and computing of the application/ software
bios main purpose is to get the desired the
output so that misses and incidents are
reduced . Also,it is necessary to maintain
Dedestratys .
Brivacy and security of dithers, cyclists and
But the data collected is from CCTVs s other
and
means therefore it is necessary to install poroper
camisas fully functioning & softwares and
devices have all the ulti-virused installed
(ari)
reduced maintainence
Reduction in maintamence will surely effect the
company no maxtormence is an mp itetla .
of the maintenance of CCTV cameras, installed
softwares & devices are not done focsindically
then chances are that wrong or incomplete
is being collected which will had to wrong
ondalygations .
Also switle this, security and privacy of data
is also threatened .
b )
As KI has grown and gone international, so it
will be beneficial to build their own Arriate
cloud so as it trovides them to handle
9
work in accordance to them , everything will be
in control of their hands
But surely it will inc. deployment casts,
-
establishment costs, maintaince is
increased, large workload etc.
so if company does not have enough resources
el enough wirney , they can also off for
hybrid where they comenjoy both the
features of private and public cloud.
But if rompany is able to pay and handle
the limitations then they should
definitely oft for private cloud.
