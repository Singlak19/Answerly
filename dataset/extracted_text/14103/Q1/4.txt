Would increase the procened results

importent .
( u ) No upfront Cost :
- In context of cloud services used by the KI,
the're would be no upfront cost . ( other costs
would be buying
comeras & dedicated computing
at recording site ).
thees, KI
need no much upfront cost
for getting cloud computing go but could

( iii ) reduced

- As processing of interesting cases and their

by the CSP. Te. replicating storage to

( ii) Ip the cost of using a public cloud

(iv) Also, KI should consider the potential of
going out of business in near future. If that
is expected, constructing a porvate cloud would be
al
wasteful
- Only going international doesn't justify
for
creating a porvate cloud.
