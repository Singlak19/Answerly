Bisol Hyper - jacking
It is a seemerio, where all the systems
with its database, virtual machines , data
weto accessed by an unauthorised person
There is no other way by which an organisation
can free its data andl virtual machines
except pivity, ranson to the hacker.
Following are the "security Threats. and
vulnerabilities which are inherent a in
virtualized Systems.
( a) Unauthorised access to other UM & data
As the Virtual machines always share the
game Physical hardware it can be
possible that an unintended uses might
set access to another . " data Cvm )
It can happen due to disfuncting of
Some module of hypervisor .

( b) compromised hypervisor,
The biggest threat to Virtual machines
is combroused hypervisor. once the
hacher pet contral over the hypervisor,
it can get control over all the
virtual machines operating @ under It,
Apart from it . if hypervisor stops functing
well, It can Rose access over UM
and It can result in anomalies of
the System.
( ? ) VM sprawds
I'm Sprowl is a situation , where the
the ho of VMS incieeyes on the host
and vast no of VMS are Remained
idle,
This
results in sheer wastage of
resources and it compounds the
performance of the whole system .

( ! ) Um Escape :
i'm Escabe Is a situation where hacher
or unauthorised besson escape the Security
measures of hypervisor, and controls they
virtual machines

( @ ) Im Isolations
pms does not share the same, physical
hardware but there performances are
totally independent from each other.
Any bog or anomaly does not transferred.

from one um to another
(b) um myration
In this case one UM is transferred to
another without shut it down . vm Mination
is useful in following cases,
