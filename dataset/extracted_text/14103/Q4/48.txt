Myper . Jacking
Hyper - jacking is a
scendiing in which
the hypervisor is attached and it
WAMes
under the control of the
attacker. Thus, the attacker can
control
all the quest Os working over that
hyper visor
because hypervisor acts as a
single point controlling entire syskm.

hyper - jacking is, Ime if the
most dangerous threat which
ham failed the entire system.

The virtual machines which
ame trunning are also a potential
vulnerability that attackers try
-- Guest OS - There are multiple
quest OS ( multitenancy ) running
in ats virtualized system and
home they are a common

-- VM escape- A VM going out of control
If the VMM can also cause De

the VMM controlling it.
- VM Migration - During migration of Um
there is high wish as VM is
enposed .
-> VM Sprawl- If there are too many
VM's then it can be difficult for
UMM As contial them, this
leading to vulnerability
These are some of the security threats.
Security Techniques
VM Hardening - This means making sure
what to all the security
wasdates are installed a VM is configured
properly to minimize wish.
- Protection at compute -
