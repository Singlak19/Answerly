4 ) Hyper Jacking is process in which a malicious user / UM takes control over UMM horst os and hence affects other JM ion the host system It Is done by executing a specific privileged interuction which goes unchecked from UMM and imposes contents o the malicious VM . Major security threats & vulnerabilities in virtualized systems are : 1 ) UM-Escape: - UM escape is the process in which Scanned with CamScanner a malicious quest OS goes out of control of from VMM . 1 ) while miquating SM UM ( VM Migration) from one system to another over retrouda , it can empa the ule contents to the public. 3) WM sprawl: is the process in which no if quest OS is increasing and continuously eating up host tresoreLs , 4 ) 4 UM user might not have properly configumal the security of quest Os our may have installed a malicious SO 5 ) A vulnerable UMM may also pose threat to the security of quest Osis . VM- specific security techniques. 1 ) UVMM needs to configured properly to enhance security and putlect from malicious use of shared Jesources. 2) VM should hardened by configuring them 3) Porti emposed should be minimum as per arequirements 4) Properly handling priveleged instructions by VMM is necessary - Scanned with CamScanner 5 ) VM migration should done over SSL or TLS Scanned with CamScanner
