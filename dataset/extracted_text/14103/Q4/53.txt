Q. 9) ) Hyper Jacking is a hypunisol security threat at the compute level in an architecture, the hypejackeig the VMM gets compromised ky an extural attack. The VMM is now controlled by the attacker and he can euch control both the hardware and the VM and easily extract Esfor confidential information Or disrupt services of a company"after stealing important data. There are many security threats 2 vulnerabilities that all inherent in umitualized cystines: 1 ) UM axcape : This is a situation in which the ritual machine excapes from the contrd of the hypesel and goes into Scanned with CamScanner the control of a malivous wall . The nur can then modify thee OS of the witual machine to destroy the MMM and hack information from secured database . ( 11 ) UM sprawl : In this security threat the VM keeps multiplying into new UM enly though there are many VM's alllady present in idle state. This reduce the prouning pour and wastes the physical resources of the system and ultimately redes the system dis functirial if it is not caught in tinu. the VM specific security techniques are as follows : (i) VM hardening- This is the process of changing the security policy settings and fuwhey out unusable files in the OS Scanned with CamScanner of the KM. To houden the vMis to make it more secule by changing its default pettings. VM Migration- This is the process of dupli cating a UM to another VM without closing the original. It may lie required when the organization has to do load balancing or maintainence of, site. This isalso done to maintain backups in case of faulty woll changes. 8 During the process of UM migration the data & the application is at major risk do all the contents all open on the network and any attacker can easily tiensfeu these files to a conipromised Scanned with CamScanner VMM. Thus UM migration has to the cavered out with almost security. Scanned with CamScanner
