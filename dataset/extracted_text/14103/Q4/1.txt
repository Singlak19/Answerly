4. Hyber- jacking is defined as the process in watts
(DEVMM )
which the hypervisor is byjacked & is compromised.
A faulty VMM, can allow the threat poser to
get access to the hardware. Furthermore, the UMs
can be modified & malicious applications way
be installed . E.g . a web server is hyper jacked
then any new user is directed to an incorrect
or mubehaving virtual machine. so a result, the cusep
is not atte to get the desired & correct
services.

In virtualized systems, there are a large numble
of t security treats threats that are possible:

vulnerabilities in system ( external ).
B) Data Leak: Lack of proper security access rights,
data may get leaked.
Integrity :
a ) Data Segregation : Improper boundary perimeter cash
allow V.MI to access Resources of VMZ.
b) User Access : Improper IAM, can allow.

cludentials to get access to data.
C) Data Quality: One of the VMs might upload data

To address these threats mere all VM-specific
security techniques:
DVM hardening: Change default configuration
of Von to harden it against threats.
R VM Migration : VM can be migrated to other
sleevees in case of fault tolerance, load balancing
etc. As the de it travels over the network,
speciaal care must be take that it is
not sent to a compromised serve. ( Use TLS& SSL)

VM escape : UM might lecope out of the control
of VMMe can access hardware or briy

to prevent this .

V'M isolation : Even though VMs ate logically
isolated, proper isolation on the physical
level must also be maintained.
VM Sprawl : UM sprawl leads to increase in
number of VMs even if all previous allidle .
