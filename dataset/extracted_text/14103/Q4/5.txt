Hyper jacking is the care whereen the Hyperves or that is to be installed has been compromised. involves the process of adding malicious. code to the the Hypervisorss source code Jo as to disrupt its integrity In such situation , the vendor who provided the compromised Hypervisor , on the user who introduced vulnerabilities , may try gain access into the Hypervisor through a back- door eutry . can also lead to the Compro misation of isolation of VMs exposing data of one UM to other ( which the hacker "can exploit ) and introduce the scope Scanned with CamScanner for orars UM attacks Hyper - jacking is integrity this a threat to data ." and VM isolation . Possible Security Threats i ) VM escape - In this case the VM escapes out of the Hypervisor' s control . I ' t can compromise the security of other VMs being managed by that Hypervisor . VM sprawe - Now VMs are added and become dormant continuously . This in twoun affects the availability of resourcey for the genesme - srunning , odder VMs . Lead to performance bottlenecking due to clioking resources . 111 ) VM migration - During migration , a may take the UM to a compromised UMM. Hence UM migration malees security of a VM vulnerable , Scanned with CamScanner ##UM - specific security 1 . UM Hardening - This refers to the removal of vulnerable components grcom a UM OS- though security analisis - thus ( 6 ) rendering the UM, mare secure. 9 others Scanned with CamScanner
