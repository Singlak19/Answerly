Ans. Hyper - Jacking:
Hyper jacking is a situation wherein the hypervisor i.e. vierual
machine monitor is compromised. Either malicious content is
installed on it or the hypervisor comes entirely under the
control of an attacker. Simply put, all the data and
further processing that occurs "is in liste of already been
harmed . It is a part of security compromise at compute
level .
Possible security threats and vulnerabilities inherent
virtualized systems ..
1 ) Multi tenancy : since multiple unex are sharing the
resources, security becomes a major concern.
i ) Bleach in one VM can cause all the VMs to be at wish.
iii) If the hypervisor is reached , all physical resources and
vitual machines come under the control of attackes.
iv ) Victualization can easily cause an integrity failure in
case data of one VM is sent to another or in case of incorrect
instruction parsing .
V) Dueeloading of servers might lead to data loss ( since
multiple VM's, overloading of servers is inevitable ).
VI) Attacks are easier in case of virtualized systems as
there are mon and points conspending
to mmetiple
usces or VM's .
vii )
quest is seculby is always a major concern and theeat.

VM specific security techniques:
i ) VM hardening :
When the underlying virtual machine is provided with more
security measures to have VMs installed on it be more secure.
ii ) VM escape
when vitual machine escapes the control of hypervisor, it
law came security concerns. To prevent such a situation, it is
Necessary to
iui ) VM isolation :
Two VMs Installed un same system are logically isolated hurt
some sort of physical isolation and distance is also essential.
iv) VM migration :
Migration of a UM From one machine to another in situations
of load balancing or overloading of servees .
V ) UM splace :

In this situation multiple new VMs or hosts keep getting
installed while majority of those installed are in idle state .'
