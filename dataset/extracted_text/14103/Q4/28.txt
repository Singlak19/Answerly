Dns. y Hyper- jacking Hypervisor Can be " a single point of farlivre in cloud computing . of the hyper-visor is compromised them it is known as Hyper-jacking. A comprovused hypervisor con . ect a - Shut -down other VMs b - Make false configuration of VMs running C- Run malicious software on a VM A - Install another compromised VMM onto the system. e - Unauthorised Provisoire of resources can be done - Security Threats & Vulnerabilities 1) Maticious VM user (VM-Escape ) A malicious VM user might take control of the system or resources. by This Escape of control is also known as VM- Escape , when the control goes out of the UMM. Scanned with CamScanner 11 ) Compromised VMM The hypervisor , if compromised can let the VMs to take full control of the virtualised systems This is also known as hyper-jacking. 111 ) VM- Sprawl If a many VMS are initialised on the systems but none of lovemost of them are idle, ... Areyouny are wasted on a large scale ! VM- Specific security Techniques -! 1 ) VM- hardening In VM hardening, the alteration is done on the default configuration of the Vitual Machine to make sure of 56 higher level of security 1 ) Trusted - Platform-Module ( TPM ) TPM is woed for providing hardware based verification of VM and the hypervisor. This adds a + check to security the underlying system ( VMM K VM ) Scanned with CamScanner
