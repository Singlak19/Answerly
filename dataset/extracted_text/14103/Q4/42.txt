Ans-4. os Hyper-pakking of hypervisor hijacking transfers the control of the by parors of or Virtual machine Marage, (VMM) ite a malicious. user or software . It may lead to data theft or unauthorized modification im the OS or storage or virtual machine. - Security threat's and vulnerabilities inherent in virtualized system care: Data theft :- As the physical resources are booked, there is a threat of data leak by a malicious software or hardware attack. . Velocity of attack: Bue to transmission of tera bytes of dataover the shared architecture, there is threat of loss of confidentiality of data Threat to YM :-VMis as kan be controlled by some unauthorized usey in case the configuration of the quest OS is not done properly. - Also, during XM migration, the data passes through various software that can bea threat to Vm security its not configured properly. Scanned with CamScanner . Hypervisor security: In case the hypervisor its not secured properly. it can lead to a threat to both the underlying physical architecture and the working of virtual machines as well, vm-specific security techniques are as follows :- " VM-hardening:- It refers to the hardening of VM is. modifying the virtual machine to improve security . VM- isolation It ensures data is one VM can't be viewed or modified by a user on some other virtual machine. 8 . Handling VM- sprawl:- VM sprawl means continuously creating knew VMs while the previous VMS have been sitting idle. In order to the Cloud service be availableall the time Ym. sprowl needs to be addressed . Secure Vmmigration : Softwares through which VM goes through during migration should reliable and secure enough to protect the confidentiality integrity and availibility of the VM.
