2 4 Hyper- Jacking can be defined as the phenomenon When a hyper Visor ( Virtual machine monitor ) escapes the control of the authorized entities This is entremely dangerous snice te carefaree he Virtual machines ander it are now compromised. Hay The malicious user can now do anything to the compromised Ums. entrait their data, sun malicious arts on them . There is a hossitulity that the neighbouring hyperusers may also be at a risk! In a Virtualized System, the threats can occur at 14 different levels a ) os level 1 1 ) vm level C ) myher Visor level d ) Physical with a struture level. Atte the Os level, an unhardened OS , ABE" unsecured API, malicious applications can cause problems. At the Um level, there are a number of prolitems that I can occur such as Scanned with CamScanner as an unhardened I'm evests this may lead to UM escape . at the hyper Visor level, the hypervisor may I fall Et wito the control of a malicious user and this leads to all the Virtual machines under it compromised. at the physical level, ports such as network intery. (ethernet), USB ports ernest and they have not been disabled. Um sheific security techniques - 1) Um isolation- Isolation one Um from another I'm completely in order to prevent- any data leage leakage. 2) Um hardeningAltering the default configuration of the Um in order to make it more secure. 3 ) Um Migration - when Um is migrated from one physical server to another without Shutting down. This should be done in a secure manner, since if not done properly the entire Un may the I compromised. Others Scanned with CamScanner
