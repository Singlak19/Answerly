HyperjackingTakes place in a situation where Uritual VMachine Hypervisor is attacked by a malicious attacker nwho created a separate Virtut Machine within the Attacked Virtual Machine, 7 UM UM Hypojacking, Hyper visor Hardware Scanned with CamScanner Various threads and vulnerabilities inherent to Virtual Machines can be listed as.: D Ke Multitenancy: As the resources are shared beivon various VM's it poses a threat 9 daxa leak between various UMS . Overloading: overloading of physical resources due to UM overlading can cause latency issues. 3 UM Migration : UM migration must take place without knowledge and various VM's must be compatible for migration to take place- 9. Information security : Data at rest and while transit must be encrypted and it must be destroyed after use. 3). Infrastructure Security : Host, Network I. Application level security must be main tained . Scanned with CamScanner Identity security: Proper authorization must take place and more granular approach mud be followed . VM escafee: This occurs when attackers enter the UM and take control of d . Varios UM specific security techniques and as follows : 7 UM Hardening : UM musth change its default configurations to make it more secure- UM Isolation.: VM's must be devold of each others presence so that if one UM is compromised, others can be saved from the attack 3 UM Saranl : mis robbers when there are of lox of VM's and most of ham are idle, This must be avoided to improve efficiency.
