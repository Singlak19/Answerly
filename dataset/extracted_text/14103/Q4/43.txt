4. Hyper- Jacking : In hyber- jacking, a VMM is compromised and it goes out of control, endangering the VMs under its control. When a UMM twins malicious of or is hijacked by a harbor, it son highly probable that the virtual machines and applications running on them will tron Malicious. Normal security cheeks or practizes cannot remove hyper-jacking as an inside resource has been compromised. This pases threats for other UMMs as well. Security threats in virtualized systems : . UM theft: In this, a UM escapes or goes out of control. There must be a security breach or a malicious software is installed on the UM. This poses threat for other UM. also, installed on the same hardware . Weak separation between UM. It may sometimes happen that the multiple VM. installed on the same machine are not isolated properly. This may lead to errors or security breaches VM sprawl: When there is an increase in the number of VM: installed when there are also many other UM. remaining idle . It leads to UM abrawl . UM hardening : When the UM is not hardened, it is possible to change its configurations for unauthorized porpor. Migration : Migrating from one virtualized system to other can have an alverse impart on availability and accessibility. Scanned with CamScanner VM-specific security techniques : Iis VM hardening. It means that the basic UM configuration is altered in such a way that it becomes even more sure, UM access: Acess to the UM should be properly authenticated and authorized. (111) Individual VMs can have their own anti-virus installed ever if there is one for the whole UMM. liv) UM Migration. While migrating a UM from one UMM to other can be dangerous. So, it should be carried out with care, 8 (V) OS security. The OS installed on the UM should comply with the security standards. Scanned with CamScanner
