- VM Repudiation : wherein permission to allocate new
VM's is not given
* In order to mitigate with The threats that working
in a virtualized env. offers, The following should
be diligently adhered to :
- UM isolation : each VM should be agnostic of
the presence of any other VM . The abstraction
I should be foolproof and
complete
- VM hardening : There should be no loose ends
left. All extra VM processes should be shut off .
no ghost ports should be left active.
- Quest os Annlication hardening: All processes
running in the VM should be auditable Prefer
logging should be done.
- Timely configuration updates "should be followed.
