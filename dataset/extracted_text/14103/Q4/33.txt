Hyper-Jacking refers to the hypervisor being
attacked and put under compromised seaviity.
The hypervisor is the software firmware that
Creates and eins virtual
machines. In case of
hypervisor been security breach, all the vMs under
that hypervisor are at risk and also the under-
lying shavedware might be affected ..
Security threats and vulnerabilities in a virtualized
System
1 Hypervisor security is the key. If the hypervisor is
breached , all the ums under the vMm would
be under the control of the attacker. The attacker
could also gain access to the hardware (storage
and metwreck ) through his access on the hypervisor.
2 )
Threats to Confidentiality of data :
a ) intermal attacker
- at the cloud service provider i might
be logging user information and activities ; could
even replicate a um and misuse client forma-
tion .
- at the customer " might pide uf passwords

and again unauthenticated access to a
um .
b )
External attacker
- a software attack on the cloud infrastrucation.
- a software attack on the cloud services
- a software / hardware attack on the
cloud user/ client's end machines.
-
a hardware attack on cloud infrastructure
- lored social engineering
Sech attacks might be launched on the
Cloud service / infrastructure which would
pose a security threat to the UMs and
data .
c ) Data Leakage
- unauthorized intentional / unintentional leakage
sensitive reformation
might lead to an
attack on the closed (as that leaked
information
might land of in wering hands).
3) Threats to integrity of data
- Invalid / Incorrect data security perimeters
- Euvalid configuration of Vms.
Scanned with CamScanner
- faulty data / applications . In case of a
multitenant model , faulty applications on
Due UM might lead to security threat's and
breaches to data in Other UMs on the
same hardware.
(14 Threats to availability of services
- Denial of Service attack : an attacker might
flood the service endpoint with
fictiones requests and make the service
go into a denial
of service mode
(partially or wholly )
- Physical intrusion to resources : at the cloud
service provider or the customer fr
any third party provider.
- Unavailability
if services: The CSP server
might be down or to
the internet service
outage might have occured.

VM Escape
VM Escape us a situation where a malicious vm
escapes the control of its VMM. This can cause
the VM to be infected and also might infect the

other um's un the network .
6 VM Sprawl
A situation
in which the mo. of VM's on a
specific hardware resource are continuous
increasing with most of the initial UMs being
Idle . This
would lead to wastage

gresources.
7
Um
Miquation
During the migration of a um , it is exposed to the
network and all the threats associated with it.
VM specific security techniques
0 um Hardening . A technique in restich the
defaillt configuration of a virtual machine
is changed, in order to achieve a higher
level of security Rund privacy.
2
VM Isolation : Multiple VM's might be running
In the same hardemore / wunder the same VIMM.
Special care must be take to ensure that
the
different UMs are isolated from each other
le . they wwwen independently and malware
of each other's existance.

3 um migration :
um migration us the process
migrating a Um from one device to
another ( with the same manufacturer's processor)
without twining the UM
This exposes
the UM and x
related
data
to
the metwork
migration is done for fault tolerance, load
balancing etc , and must be dove withe
extra
care security and precautious.
4)
Authentication : Along with isolation, peper
carre must be taken while providing
access to any UM resources. The access meest-
be authenticated properly so as to ensure
that mo faulty access is being granted.
