Clouds are not inherently secure.
They meest be secured by analyzing the
different privacy concerns and the types of
attacks attackers who might want to gain
access to the data services ien an Umailthorio
marmer.
Security and privacy implications in cloud
1 Multitenancy_
multiple ' untrusted' tenants
On the same network / hardware may
pose a threat to the security of
the data being stored / or
shared that
cloud network.
2 )
Compliance : the security levels provided by
the DSP per the compliance agreements
must be properly wread, understood
and
dealt with. ' Who's managing what
meest be clear beforehand and on a
contractual basis.
Access Rights : ' Who has access to my data ? '
O% How can someone ( device ( channel)
access my data or the cloud?" are
the implications related to access rights
in the mind ob
a cloud service
client .
4
Retention :
How much data ( personal ( public )
is being retained with the CSP and for what
purpose is important to be knowth and
analysed in a cloud service structure.
Destruction. Once a cloud client asks for
the deletion of some data on the cloud,
is it preally deleted ? Does the CSP delete
all versions and copies of the concerned
data? or does it just wwwoke the
clients access to the data and use the
data for its owen analysis ( data mining ?
These quistious need to be answered to a
cloud client to make him comfortable
4 ) using any cloud service.
16 Location : Cloud Service Providers do not
generally disclose the location of the
data storage to the owner of the
data . This is due to security veasons .
But it might be the case that some data
(might have to be prevented from being
istoeed in a specific location. Special
measures need to be applied to ensure they
Entitlement :
Who is entitled to do what
to a specific data? ie. who can
mead ( viers the data , who can
actually edit the data and who
can delete the data?
These are the
implications of multiple users induem.
But
in a cloud application deployment.
Legal and Regulatory measures : the legal and
regulatory measures swing to cloud security
are different in different countries / states.
This can pose a trouble for MNC's whose
data and applications must be distributed
Over servers in various mations.
9 )
Transit and Storage : whether a COP
provides encugeted storage or the client
has to take care ofit
if the transit- over
the melwork is ver of
therough isocure fustocol ( SSL )TLS)
(10) Disaster/ Breach management:
In linew of an actual/ data breach, what
would be the remedial measures taken and
who would be responsible
"for the breach ? This
must be discussed between the client and
provider at an early stage Do as to prevent
