cloud environments
are vulnerable
to a number
of security
and privacy threats. These concerns
need
to
be
addressed before successful adoption.
SECURITY
CONCERNS :
*
IDENTITY
SECURITY :
+ Erwoher auth N and auth z needs to be
maintained
- Impeccable I AM practices need to ve followed
- Strong author is required
to
avert identity
theft such as spoofing, & unauthorized access etc
- Higher granularity needs to be looked at to
aword identity security issues .
* socentity security breaches may lead to compromise
with data integrity ,data theft, misuse etc
*
INFORMATION
SECURITY :
- Threat
to
confidentiality - Integrity - Availability
tread of
security of data
- Retention and Data - shredding policies.
- Inhibit data- life cycle
I CIA security model should be adonted to
ensure
information security
INFRASTRUCTURE
SECURITY :
- de compute level
: different layers of cloud
architecture it .
physical server, VM, rostos
guest os ,
Application software can be
targetted as a weak zone
- At network
level : svertaking & intercepting
network
information to draw inferences or
detect data.
com
be tackled by firewalls, DMZ,
enoughtion
it storage lwel: physical location of sover
needs to be protected from security risks as well
Biometric auth, CCTV cameras are some measury
which
can be deployed at location.
These security concerns con also be listed as.
Theceat to.
- data at rest
data in transit
- authentication
separation between customers
-
cloud legal and regulatory measures
> incident response.
PRIVACY
CONCERNS '
- Access : user should know what data is colledid
from it . Also , usch should have a say on
what can be done with o that data.
- Compliance : all terms &
conditions agreed to
are followed properly
y
Storage : Safe storage is insured by means of
enerightion
Retention: Data is retained only till the time it
is required
- Destruction : Complete & Absolute destruction of data Eakes
place once it moves out of life cycle
no illegitimate
copies are mountained
+ Auditing
& monitoring
