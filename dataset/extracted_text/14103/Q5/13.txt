Anse
we can say That partially Cloud ore security.
not fully Security Depends on many Things like
D type of Deployment model
if it is private of community then it is
secured elie not secured
2 )
type of architecture
if it is a layer architecture, with security
being provided at each loyer then it is
secured else not
Security A Privacy implication ore-
Los of confidential information of cloud usere
can lead the
privicy breach .
2) 96
@ UM is attacked
it could lead
Reat
to
cross UM attack of
network traffic
Dest
riv
Copturing or Deaid of services
Audit
3 )
" hypervisor is attacked it could offect
all the VM's roaring on it.
in SCA
4 )
Company should dearly
mention
that what it does with user
doha .
Because
they might
use user confidentid ina
E which leads
to loss of
Confidentiality
ex- Facebook Sold wer data to Andytis
company
5) 9/ Dotv Shredding is not done then traces
of Data might be left with cloud provider
which could lead to privacy Breach
6 )
Dota should be retained only till the
time application is deployed on The CSP.
che its removed
all traces is log files
of Dota Should be removed
7 ) 9/
attacker is able to attack a UMM he
may be able to access underlying hardcore
ultimately might be able to Reach to Storage
loyer.
ih some attack hoppenn the CSP has te
stop the services for some time untill
unless point of attack is not identified I
fresolved, This would help CSP from any
further Security & breach . But will rincure
huge losses to the CSP.
