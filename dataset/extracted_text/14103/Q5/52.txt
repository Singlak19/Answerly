1 ) Access - This refers to the occery given to the
data by CSP to
the user. Access must be
made available but only if the authentication
&
authorization systems are working .
2 ) Compliance -

systems must comply with the
local +
international
guidelines so they don't break
my laws doing it .

first.
4 )
Destruction - The data which is stored must
be destried properly after une so that it
doesn't leave a trace behind Data Shredding
must be done in appropriate time.
5)
Audit & Monitoring - CSP's
must provide tools
I services for uvers to keep a track of
their stored data and to see if the csp
is following all propes rules f
regulations .
6) Privacy Breaches - CSP should specify the
protocols & practices to ensure breaches don't
occor 4
the practices to be undertaken after
a breach . This includes holding correct party
responsible & returning to service as quickly as
possible while minimizing damage done .
