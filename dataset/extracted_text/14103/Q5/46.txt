hot secure. while nothing could be called 100% secure, the very
architecture of cloud- computing, its usage over the network,
flexibility for users add to many serity and privacy
threats to cloud systems.
Security and Privacy implications of cloud computing!!
* Authorization and Identification : On the CSP end , authorization
and identity verification module, being central to system, is
prove to security attacks. on Usu's kind, a single reg im into chard
to by unauthorized individual ( may be prishing, 'social engiuly )
result, in complete compromise of system.

per the internet, which itself is a huge vulnerability.
Data breach steal | lopy : while CSP is only a custodian of date
it may copy data ( user's data, owner's data) and use it for their
own benefits

allowing CSP into your test boundaries which is it sey a
