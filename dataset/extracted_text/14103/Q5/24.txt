Cloud security
There are mainly 3 types of cloud deployment
models:
( 1 ) Public cloud
( 2) Private Cloud
( 3 )
Hybrid cloud
There are curtain security and privacy
implications of cloud computing associated
with these three deployment models :
( 1 )
lince these are multiple tenants in a cloud
model, there is always a possibility that
some tenants ale malicious and (may misuse
the data & try to get the data of othertenants
of the cloud .
( 2 )
It is not always that Cloud service Providers
encrypt the data before storing on the cloud.
Like $3 in Amazon doesnot encrypt
data before storage.
this is another security
implication.
( 3) Home security attacks can occur when any
transaction is
being done on the cloud ift
proper authentication measures are not
taken .
(4) since CSPs provide information about their
APIs the for marketting hackers
misuse this
information to gain access of the cloud users'
data.
(5)
There is a vulnerability that even if a
customer has removed data from the
cloud ic unsubscribed to the cloud service,
then customer data can still be present with
the CSP which can use it for its own use
De sell.
(6) Bacter dee
some traces
after destruction of dais
the data are
still left which can be misused by some
Intities for their own benefits.
